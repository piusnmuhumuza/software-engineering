# Enterprise Architecture

Enterprise Architecture(EA) is an important discipline, as organizations need to understand the fundamental aspects of their business in order to keep pace with the global market and technology changes in a continually evolving world. 

Enterprise architecture (EA) is a business function concerned with the structures and behaviors of a business, especially business roles and processes that create and use business data. With Enterprise Architecture(EA) you learn how to model an Enterprise using TOGAF, including working with the Architecture Development Method (ADM) and metamodel attributes.

Enterprise architecture applies architecture principles and practices to guide organizations through the business, information, process, and technology changes necessary to execute their strategies. These practices utilize the various aspects of an enterprise to identify, motivate, and achieve these changes."

## Introduction

As a discipline, EA "proactively and holistically lead[s] enterprise responses to disruptive forces by identifying and analyzing the execution of change" towards organizational goals. EA gives business and IT leaders recommendations for policy adjustments and provides best strategies to support and enable business development and change within the information systems the business depends on. EA provides a guide for decision making towards these objectives.[5] The National Computing Centre's EA best practice guidance states that an EA typically "takes the form of a comprehensive set of cohesive models that describe the structure and functions of an enterprise. The individual models in an EA are arranged in a logical manner that provides an ever-increasing level of detail about the enterprise."

## The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)

[The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework) is a framework in enterprise architecture that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise information technology architecture.

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is one of the most widely accepted methods for developing enterprise architecture. It's a high-level approach to design typically modeled at four levels: _Business, Application, Data, and Technology_. and relies heavily on modularization, standardization, and already existing, proven technologies and products.
