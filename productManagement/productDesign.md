# Product Design

You need to know how potential customers will react to a product or if there’s market demand—all before you even start designing a product. it's safe to say, designing a product that solves real customer and market needs would be a lot easier if you could see into the future.

## Introduction

When considering high-quality products or features, designers must understand business objectives, know the elements of a good design, and be able to answer the following questions:

What problem are we solving?
Who has this problem?
What do we want to achieve?
Answering these questions allows design engineers to understand the user experience of a product as a whole, and not simply the interaction (feel) or visual (look) part of a design.

### Finding a solution to a problem includes the following five basic phases

1. Research: In order to develop a deeper understanding of your consumer audience, you must conduct and gather research to cater to the people for whom you are designing your product/service for. This is crucial.

2. Define: Create a point of view that is based on user needs and insights.

3. Brainstorm: In order to generate a wide range of potential solutions, design thinking and brainstorming sessions are required during this phase of product development.

4. Prototype: After narrowing down design concepts, build a prototype (or series of prototypes) to test your hypothesis. Creating a prototype allows the designer to discover if they’re on the right track, and it often sparks different ideas that you wouldn’t have come up with otherwise to further streamline product development. However, depending on the product, physical prototyping tools can be very expensive so digital design can be significantly more cost-effective in the beginning stages of product design and problem-solving pain points within the design.

5. Test: Return to your users for feedback.
As we’ve discussed, creating and building great products (and great brands) is contingent upon forward-thinking design implementation. Today’s businesses essentially rely upon their product design team to give their products or services an aesthetic and functional edge over their competitors while maintaining relevance in a world where technological advancement never sleeps.

## What is Product Design

Product design is the process of ideating, developing, and refining products that meet specific market needs and solve user problems.

User interface (UI) and UX design fit into product design, but center around the product’s usability, look, and user experience (UX). Product design also involves improving usability and the user experience, but in context—by focusing on big-picture implications like process, cost, and the brand’s overall position in the market.

A product designer helps create products that delight customers by defining product and business goals, and anticipating market opportunities and user needs.

## Product Designer

A Product Designer helps to define the experience and interface of products (also known as ‘User Experience’ or UX and ‘User Interface’ or UI) while defining the brand and marketing strategy around those products. Essentially, it is creating a brand and executing that identity through every phase of the product or services’ lifespan and design strategy – aesthetically, experientially, tactilely, ergonomically, and technologically speaking, of course.

### The Role Of A Product Designer?

Due to the vast (and ever-changing) demands of the Product Designer, it is by definition a rather elusive job role to describe: because the design process of product development keeps changing, the roles of people (and consequent skills sets) continue to evolve, thus encompassing a wider scope of responsibilities. Because of this, it is important that anyone entering the field have the proper hands-on training with a respectable design program. While Visual Designers address the look and feel of a product, UX or UI Designers deal with wireframes and user flows. However, the Product Designer is an individual who can take a high-level concept and see it all the way through, from inception to completion.

Responsible for designing nearly everything we use in our daily lives, Product Designers utilize their creativity, technical knowledge and keen eye for detail to design and implement new and innovative products and services, as well as streamlining existing products by improving their aesthetic appeal and functionality. In order to succeed in product design, you must understand the relationship between art, technology, and science. As a Product Designer, your responsibilities will include planning, designing, and modeling products, creating prototypes and conducting research, as well as rigorous product testing.

A Product Designer’s Role May Also Include:

Wireframing
Coding/Prototyping
Creating style guides and patterns
Conceptualizing product definitions and naming conventions
Building requirements documentation with other engineers and designers
Manning support and helping fill tickets to better understand customers from the front-lines
Any number of other things to help tie up loose ends on the design side

### A general outline of the Product Designer’s work process:

* Research & Consultation: Initially, you’ll be expected to work from your client’s specs, liaising with your client and staff to understand the criteria for the product before brainstorming concepts and prototypes. You’ll also need to conduct a fair amount of research during the product vision and development phase.

* Brainstorm: After the initial brainstorming phase, you will be required to produce a series of preliminary sketches/drafts and other presentations to outline your design ideas.

* Design: Once your preliminary ideas have been approved, you will begin to create detailed designs; typically this entails computer-aided design (CAD) software as well as producing technical specifications, which will detail everything in the design system from required materials to product costs.

* Prototype Development: The next phase of the process entails prototype development of the final product, which may involve 3-D design, sketches or state-of-the-art computer software, depending on the complexity and demands of the project.

* Prototype Testing: Finally, you’ll be responsible for testing the prototype. This may require a hands-on approach or computer-simulated testing, depending on the nature of your project. During the final phases of prototype testing, you’ll need to make important design-related decisions, such as budget constraints, and in some instances, environmental impact as well as health and safety regulations.
Once the prototype has been designed, developed and tested, you’ll be required to present the final product design to the client for their approval. Unless the client is dissatisfied with the results (and changes need to be made), this is the last phase of a product design project’s life cycle.
