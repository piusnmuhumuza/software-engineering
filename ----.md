## Models & Standards

[ISO/IEC 17025:2017 General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories [which is This standard was last reviewed and confirmed in 2023. Therefore this version remains current at the time of publishing this article] - ISO/IEC 17025 is the international standard for testing and calibration laboratories. It sets out requirements for the competence, impartiality, and consistent operation of laboratories, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of their testing and calibration results.]( https://www.iso.org/standard/66912.html)
The ISO/IEC 25000 series of standards, also known as SQuaRE (System and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation), contains a framework to evaluate software product quality. ISO/IEC 25010 defines a set of eight software quality characteristics, or system “-ilities,” i.e. security, reliability, and maintainability.

### ISO 25010 Standard Overview

ISO25010 describes two quality models:
•	The quality in use model composed of five characteristics (some of which are further sub-divided into sub-characteristics) that relate to the outcome of interaction when a product is used in a particular context of use.
•	A product quality model composed of eight characteristics (which are further sub-divided into sub-characteristics) that relate to static properties of software and dynamic properties of the computer system.
The characteristics and sub-characteristics provide consistent terminology for specifying, measuring and evaluating system and software product quality. They also provide a set of quality characteristics against which stated quality requirements can be compared for completeness.

•	[ISO/IEC 25019:2023 Systems and software engineering [Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)] – which defines a quality-in-use model composed of three characteristics (which are further subdivided into sub-characteristics) that can influence stakeholders when products or systems are used in a specified context of use.]( https://www.iso.org/standard/78177.html)
