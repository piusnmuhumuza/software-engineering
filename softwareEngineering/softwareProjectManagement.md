# Software Project Management

This is a holistic approach to managing software projects with a business engineering mindset which focuses on the management of project information, resourcing, costing and budgeting to deliver on-time, on-budget and in-scope projects in Software Engineering.

## Introduction

Before the agile Methodology, the most popular methodology for managing projects was Waterfall Methodology — the oldest and most traditional project management methodology that follows a sequential process where each step must be completed before the next can begin.

The key difference between Agile and Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks down software development into isolated phases that flow into each other, while Agile advocates for iterative development cycles which can run concurrently.

## Agile

Agile is the ability to create and deal with uncertainty by responding to constant change, where teams are able to deliver quality products by upholding central values & behaviors of; — _trust, Flexibility, empowerment and collaboration._

Teams choose agile so they can respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly without derailing a year's worth of plans. "Just enough" planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets your team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at minimal cost.

> Focus on the 20% that matter for an 80% effect.

One of the most effective ways to utilize Agile is using _**MoSoCoW** Prioritization_ (MoSoCoW Method) which stands for; —

* **Must** ‐ Cannot deliver/go live without this.
* **Should** ‐ Important but not vital
* **Could** ‐ Wanted or desirable but less critical. _“nice to haves”_
* **Won’t** ‐ the team has agreed it will not deliver.

### Characteristics of Agile

* Agile projects produce and deliver work in short bursts (or sprints) of anything up to a few weeks repeated to refine the working deliverable until it meets the client’s requirements.
* Collaborative relationships are established between stakeholders and the team members delivering the work at the beginning of the project and continuing until the project is concluded or even after.
* Agile projects need documentation, reviews and processes just as traditional projects do to meet requirements, manage costs and schedules, deliver benefits and avoid scope creep
* Unlike traditional waterfall project management, Agile doesn’t need to fully understand the project requirements before work can begin. Instead, emphasis is put on delivering a tangible working product (MVP) in short periods which can then be refined until it meets client needs.
* Project progress is measured in a series of working deliverables. So teams need to focus on that 20% of the User Stories (functional work) that contain 80% of the customer value, do those first, deliver them, and repeat.

### The Agile Manifesto

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), originally published in February 2001, is a document,  that identifies [four key values](https://agilemanifesto.org/);—

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

and [12 principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html);—

1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.

which its authors believing they were uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it wanted software developers to be able to use to guide their work.

Formally called the Manifesto for [Agile Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), it was produced and published by [17 Software Developers](https://agilemanifesto.org/authors.html);—

### What is Agile Project Management?

In Project Management, the Agile approach centres around step-by-step incrementally and iteratively delivering requirements throughout the project lifecycle to completing projects.

Agile Project Management is an iterative approach to managing software development projects by focusing on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration.
Agile is a group of methodologies that demonstrate a commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement.

### Agile Methodologies

An Agile methodology is a project management approach that involves breaking a project into phases while emphasizing continuous collaboration and improvement. Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating depending on the methodology used.
The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 marks the birth of agile as a methodology. Since then, many agile frameworks have emerged such as scrum, kanban, lean, and Extreme Programming (XP). 

Each embodies the core principles of frequent iteration, continuous learning, and high quality in its own way. [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) and XP are favored by software development teams, while kanban is a darling among service-oriented teams like IT or human resources.

#### Project Management methods that fall under Agile include;-

1. **Scrum**, a popular agile methodology that uses daily stand-ups, backlog grooming, and sprint planning meetings to keep teams aligned and productive.
2. **Lean Methodology**, an iterative process that focuses on eliminating waste is based on the philosophy that “less is more.” This methodology is perfect for projects with limited budgets and tight deadlines they would only focus on features and tasks essential to meeting the customer’s needs, eliminating extras to keep costs down and improve efficiency.
3. **Kanban Methodology**, a great project management tool that helps manage workflow by placing tasks on a Kanban board where workflow and progress can be tracked by all team members. Agile teams use Kanban boards to map user stories and plan backlogs in software development or other agile projects and lean manufacturing to reduce inefficiencies.
Kanban (Japanese for sign) developed by Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, is an inventory control system used in Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing to track production and order new shipments of parts and materials. It was studied by Toyota which applied it to their lean manufacturing model, known as the Toyota production system.
4. **Dynamic System Development Method(DSDM)**, an Agile project delivery framework created in 1994, that focuses on the entire project lifecycle using an iterative and incremental approach to systems development.
DSDM is one of the earliest agile methodologies that was initially used as a software development method originally sought by Project Managers to provide some discipline and governance to the rapid application development (RAD) method for rapid software development and delivery.

#### Other Popular Project Management Methodologies include;

1. **Critical Path Method (CPM)**, a mathematically based planning technique used to identify and optimize the sequencing of tasks necessary for project completion and determine scheduling flexibilities to achieve the desired outcome.

A critical path in project management is the longest sequence of activities that must be finished on time for the entire project to be completed.
It is used to calculate the earliest possible time an entire project can be completed by identifying the longest path of tasks, or “critical path,” that must be achieved to finish the project on time.

2. **PRINCE2**, Projects IN Controlled Environments(the second version of its kind) thus the acronym PRINCE2 is a well-structured methodology that provides the themes, principles, and processes to control and deliver successful projects of any size and complexity.

This popular framework is based on the tried and tested experiences of project management practitioners around the world and has a globally recognized certification. It is also used for managing UK government and private sector projects even though it’s been criticized for being inflexible and bureaucratic.

3. **Six Sigma**, a set of methodologies and tools used to improve quality and business processes by identifying what is not working in the project, reducing defects/errors, minimizing variation, and increasing efficiency.
Six Sigma which also applies to quality management, was introduced by engineers working at Motorola in the mid-1980s, with the goal of Six Sigma of achieving a level of quality that is nearly perfect, with only 3.4 defects per million opportunities.

4. **Extreme Programming (XP)**, is an agile software development framework built upon values, principles, and practices, with short development cycles and multiple releases to improve productivity and allow small to mid-sized teams to produce high-quality software and adapt to evolving and changing requirements.
Although many of the XP practices have been around for a while. XP was Created by Kent Beck while working on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System payroll project, as a project leader. In 1999, after leading the C3 project for three years, he published a book (“Extreme Programming Explained”) explaining the Extreme Programming process.

### Scrum for Agile Project Management

An agile team unites under a shared vision, then brings it to life the way they know is best. Each team sets their own standards for quality, usability, and completeness. Their _"definition of done"_ then informs how fast they'll churn the work out. Although it can be scary at first, company leaders find that when they put their trust in an agile team, that team feels a greater sense of ownership and rises to meet (or exceed) management's expectations.

[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), a well-known Agile framework for software project management that.  It is a way to get work done as a team in small pieces at a time, with continuous experimentation and feedback loops along the way to learn and improve as you go thus aligning with the Agile philosophy.

#### The Origin of Scrum

Ken Schwaber & Jeff Sutherland first co-presented a paper, [“The SCRUM Development Process”](), in 1995 at the Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications (OOPSLA) Conference ’95 in Austin, Texas. This was its first public appearance. After its first full implementation at the Easel Corporation in 1993 by Jeff Sutherland, John Scumniotales, and Jeff McKenna, the paper essentially documented the learning that they gained over the previous few years.

The word scrum was adopted from scrimmage in rugby which is used to restart a play after a foul.

A scrimmage included players from each team locking into a scrum until one side gained possession of a rugby ball to resume play. The object of rugby is to move the ball down and up the field one possession at a time until a try is made and as such scrum envisioned to do the same with projects.

Therefore, the focus changes from trying to win the project(game) in one go and try to win each and every milestone and deliverable in sprints (plays/possessions in rugby).

The Scrum approach allows teams to deliver milestones as small pieces in a specific short period, with a specified number of team members.  Just like rugby, winning the small plays/possessions at a time to gain ground on a rugby pitch eventually wins the game, thus as with scrum, completing each milestone in short sprints eventually leads to a successful project completion.

Scrum focus on feedback and regular communication where;-

* The team meets regularly to discuss how they are doing,
* what problems they are encountering, and how they can improve their process.

This constant feedback loop helps ensure that the project stays on track and that any issues are dealt with quickly.

#### Scrum Values

A project team’s success when using scrum depends on five values — _Courage, Focus, Commitment, Respect, and Openness._

![The Scrum Values!](https://github.com/piusnmuhumuza/businessEngineering/blob/main/resources/scrum-values.png "Scrum Values") *Scrum Values*

#### The Scrum Framework

A scrum team uses a scrum framework as a way to encourage transparency, inspection, and adaptation when bringing a product from an idea to life.

![The Scrum Framework!](https://github.com/piusnmuhumuza/businessEngineering/blob/main/resources/scum-framework.png "Scrum framework") *Scrum Framework -Image source: Scrum.org*

The Framework guides the scrum development team in creating a product, with the help of a dynamic list of the most valuable things to do thus focusing on value and high visibility of progress.

[The Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) (the ever-evolving manual for Scrum; Schwaber & Sutherland, 2020) says that to reflect the “responding to change” value, a software project should be broken into development Sprints that are usually two to four weeks long. Each Sprint has a Sprint Plan. Sprint Plans can be defined shortly before the Sprint; Teams (and their customers) might only know what is happening with the project’s development for a couple weeks at a time.

Scrum Teams fit their own methods into the Scrum framework, which the current version of the Scrum Guide divides into three categories: the team, the events, and the artifacts.

#### Scrum Team

The Scrum Team in Scrum typically has three roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team and each team member has a specific role and responsibility within the Scrum framework.

* **A Product Owner** Who also has a leadership role, represents the voice of the customer and has the authority to make decisions about the product but may contribute as a team member.

  * He/She is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.
  * He/She decides whether to release or continue development, constantly re‐prioritizing the Product Backlog, and adjusting long-term targets such as releases.
  * As the final judge of requirements questions while considering stakeholder interests he/she is responsible for product vision and the single person responsible for maximizing the return on investment (ROI) of the development effort.

* **A SCRUM Master** Usually has no management authority over the team but is the keeper of the process, who protects and advocates for the team.

  * “He/She is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.
  * He/She works with the organization to make Scrum possible by ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted by creating an environment conducive to team self-organization, promoting improved engineering practices, and providing leadership.
  * He/She also shields the team from external interference and distractions and helps resolve impediments.

* **The Scrum Development Team** is a cross‐functional, self‐organizing, self‐managing, intensely collaborative team of five to seven people at “best” who are jointly responsible for the delivery of the product.

  * these are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
  * A Scrum Development team plans one sprint at a time with the Product Owner and has autonomy regarding how to develop the increments.
  * Scrum Development teams are most successful when located in one team room, particularly for the first few Sprints with long‐term or full‐time membership.

By and large, The Scrum Master’s focus is process, the Product Owner’s focus is the product (software), and the Developers’/Development Team's focus is creating a product while following Scrum processes.

#### SCRUM Events

Scrum defines five Scrum events(sometimes called ceremonies)

![The Scrum Events!](https://github.com/piusnmuhumuza/businessEngineering/blob/main/resources/scrum-events-time-boxes.png "Scrum Methodology") *Scrum Events Time-Boxes*

1. **A Sprint** is a short, time-boxed period within which a scrum team works to complete a set amount of tasks.fixed-length development periods of “one month or less . . . A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.” 

2. **Sprint Planning** initiates the sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum team.“initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed.” 

3. **Daily Scrum** is a 15-minute or less everyday activity of the sprint to inspect progress toward a sprint goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. “a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team . . . focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.” 

4. **Sprint Review** focus on inspecting the outcome of the sprint and determining future adaptations where the Scrum team presents results to key stakeholders and adapts the product backlog as needed based on feedback or the product owner can opt to release any of the completed functionality. “to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders . . .” 


5. **Sprint Retrospectives** help Scrum teams plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness by focusing on the process. The scrum team discusses what went well, and areas for improvement as well as making tangible plans for how to improve their processes, tools and relationships. “to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness . . . Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went . . .” 

Going through the motions and having each of the events on the calendar is not enough. To get the most out of Scrum, every Scrum Team needs to understand the purpose behind each event and how each member’s role fits.

![The Scrum Methodology!](https://github.com/piusnmuhumuza/businessEngineering/blob/main/resources/the-scrum-methodology.jpg "Scrum Methodology") *Scrum Methodology*

In a nutshell, A Sprint is a development period that occurs in a series of Sprints, which are each laid out during Sprint Planning. Each day, the Developers have a 15-minute meeting about planning the next workday. Sprints end with a Sprint Review (team and stakeholders) and a Sprint Retrospective (team only).

#### The Artifacts

There are three Scrum artifacts:

* **Product Backlog:** “an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.” The Product Backlog contains a rough list of tasks the Scrum Team is planning to do some time, but the tasks haven’t yet been scheduled and may not be defined in detail.

* **Sprint Backlog:** “composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).” The Sprint Backlog contains tasks the team has decided to work on and has added details about completing the tasks.

* **Increment:** “a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.” An Increment is an achievement toward creating the product (e.g., finishing a feature implementation).

The Scrum Guide (Schwaber & Sutherland, 2020) describes the Scrum framework elements in more detail and defines some of the terms that were unexplained here (e.g., Sprint Goal).
There are several notable Agile methods that can be used within Scrum (or other frameworks, or other software process models).

A few of them:

* **Scrum board:** A way to organize and visualize tasks or work as cards on a board. The board has columns for different categories, and each card is placed within a column. A Scrum board could be a physical bulletin board with sticky notes or index cards. It is also a common feature of task management software.

* **Spike:** A quick and to-the-point investigation for gathering information to help the team answer a question or choose a development path.

* **User story:** A short description of a software feature from the perspective of fulfilling a user need (e.g., using this format: As a ``Software Tester`` I can ``test a software product, end-to-end``, so that ``a quality software product is delivered``). Tasks, priorities, time/cost estimates, and acceptance criteria may be associated with a user story.

### Software Development Process and Tools Overview

1. Idea Conception: The initial phase where the concept for a software project is conceived and outlined.
2. Requirements Gathering: Involves collecting and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements for the software.
3. Design and Planning: Creating the architecture and planning the development process based on the gathered requirements.
4. Software Development: The actual coding and implementation of the software based on the design and plan.
5. Continuous Integration and Testing: Regularly integrating code changes and performing automated testing to ensure software quality.
6. Deployment to Staging: Deploying the software to a staging environment for further testing and validation.
7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Allowing end-users to test the software to ensure it meets their expectations and requirements.
8. Deployment to Production: Releasing the software to the live production environment for public use.
9. Monitoring and Incident Response: Continuous monitoring of the production environment, with immediate response to any incidents or issues.
10. Post-Production Iteration and Scaling: Making improvements to the software based on user feedback and scaling the system to handle increased load or demand.

## Benefits Of Agile in Software Project Management

* Businesses/clients that use Agile in project management have increased flexibility, transparency, efficiencies, speed up delivery, improved quality, have happy stakeholders and also decrease the risk of missed objectives.
* Increased flexibility and adaptability to change reducing waste and thus faster turnaround times.
* Builds accountability which facilitates faster detection of issues and defects.
* Optimal project control which increases focus on specific customer needs.
* Encourages diversity of ideas which increases improves collaboration and the frequency of feedback.

## Conclusion

Today, software development teams run lean processes to focus on end-user feedback and increased value, as noted in the Lean Startup, by Eric Ries, who advocates for rapid prototyping, end-user feedback and early and rapid product delivery.
