# THE EVERYTHING OF THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BUSINESS

The business of Software Project Management and the Economics of Software Engineering.

## INTRODUCTION

The Success of any software engineering project is partly dependent on effective business management. And Developing good software also relies on understanding the underlying economics of Software Engineering.

**Economics** is a social science concerned chiefly with description and analysis of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It's the study of how people make decisions in resource-limited situations.

**Macroeconomics** is the study of how people make decisions in resource-limited situations on a national or global scale. It deals with the effects of decisions that national leaders make on such issues "as tax rates, interest rates, foreign and trade policy.

Engineering economics quantifies the benefits and costs associating with engineering projects to determine if they save enough money to warrant their capital investments.

**Software engineering economics** addresses the elements of software project costs estimation and analysis and focuses on the economic analysis techniques and their applicability to software engineering and management.

Software Engineering Economics involves formulating, estimating, and evaluating the economic outcomes when alternatives to accomplish a defined software development purpose are available. It's all about making decisions related to software engineering in a business context.

## Economic Foundations of Software Engineering

There are fundamental principles and methodologies utilized in engineering economics and their applications in software engineering that form the basis of decision making in the presence of uncertainty. These formal economic models include the cost of production and market models based on fundamental principles of microeconomics. The dynamic values of money and assets, patterns of cash flows, can be modeled in support of management's need to make decisions in the presence the constant uncertainties associated with software development.

Economic analysis methodologies for engineering decisions include project costs, benefit-cost ratio, payback period, and rate of return can be rigorously described. This is the basis of any formal treatment of economic theories and principles. Software engineering economics is based on elements of software costs, software engineering project costs estimation, economic analyses of software engineering projects, and the software maintenance cost model.

Every time we make a decision involving multiple choices we are making an opportunity cost based decisions. Since most of the time, these costs in the future and are uncertainty, we need to estimate those opportunity costs as well as the probability that our choice is the right choice to produce the desired beneficial outcomes.

## Understanding risk and uncertainty in Software Project management

In the presence of uncertainty, making a decision about actions today that impact outcomes in the future require some mechanism for determining those outcomes in the absence of perfect information and this absence of information creates risk.

### These decisions typically have one or more of the following characteristics:

* **The Stakes** — The stakes are involved in the decision, such as costs, schedule, delivered capabilities and those impacts on business success or the meeting the objectives.

* **Complexity** — The ramifications of alternatives are difficult to understand the impact of the decision without detailed analysis.

* **Uncertainty** — Uncertainty in key inputs creates uncertainty in the outcome of the decision alternatives and points to risks that may need to be managed.

* **Multiple Attributes** — Larger numbers of attributes cause a larger need for formal analysis.

* **Diversity of Stakeholders** — Attention is warranted to clarify objectives and formulate performance measures when the set of stakeholders reflects a diversity of values, preferences, and perspectives.

### Event Risks and Non-Event Risks

If you limit your risk identification to event risks only, you will not proactively manage all risks that could affect the success of your project – and you will end up taking risks without knowing it. When most people talk about uncertainty and risk in projects, they are thinking only about uncertain future events that could have a negative (or positive) effect on achievement of their project objectives. However, risk includes much more than threats or opportunities to deliverables, the project schedule or budget.

**Event Risk:** refers to situations where you know WHAT could happen with a certain probability while **Non-Event Risks:** refers to situations where you know there is uncertainty in an area, but you don’t know exactly what it is, what could happen, or to what extent something will occur.

Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. Examples of these Event-Risks include:

* We may lose a key resource at a critical time in the project
* A key supplier may go out of business during the project
* The customer may change the requirements after the design is complete
* A subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processes

There is an increasing recognition that also **Non-Event Risks** need to be identified and managed. The following list and figure shows you an overview of Event Risks and Non-Event Risks with their underlying uncertainty.

Event risk (Stochastic Uncertainty)
Ambiguity risk (Epistemic Uncertainty)
Variability risk (Aleatoric Uncertainty)
Emergent risk (Ontological Uncertainty)

### Reducible and Irreducible Uncertainty

There is pervasive confusion between these two types of uncertainties when discussing the impacts on these uncertainties on project outcomes, including the estimates of cost, schedule, and technical performance.

All project work is driven by underlying processes that create a certain probability of uncertainty. There are two types of uncertainty on all projects, called Reducible (Epistemic) and Irreducible (Aleatory) uncertainty.

#### Reducible Uncertainty

A reducible uncertainty is called an epistemic uncertainty which refers to the deficiencies by a lack of knowledge or information while Irreducible uncertainty refers to a situation in which actors are uncertain about whether well-defined propositions (statements about future consequences which can be measured on a probability scale) are true or not.

**Event Risk** (is the result of “Stochastic Uncertainty): ”Uncertainty exist about possible events in the future, An event risk is something that has not yet happened and it may not happen at all, but if it does happen then it has an impact on one or more objectives. Most risks identified in the project risk register are event risks.

You can define actions to reduce the probability of occurrence or the impact of event risks or you can eliminate the risk completely.

**Ambiguity Risk** (is the result of “Epistemic Uncertainty”): The term epistêmê means knowledge in Greek. There are things that we are uncertain about simply because of the lack of knowledge, and the uncertainty might be reduced by gathering more information.

With ambiguous risks there is uncertainty about what might happen in the future. Areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the requirements or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic complexity in the project.

You can reduce ambiguous risks by defining those areas where there is a deficit of knowledge or understanding, then filling the gap by obtaining expert knowledge or benchmarking against best practices. You can also reduce ambiguity, for example, through incremental development, prototyping, or simulation.

#### Irreducible Uncertainty

Aleatoric uncertainty refers to the data's inherent randomness that cannot be explained away  while Epistemic uncertainty refers to the uncertainty of the model (epistemology is the study of knowledge) and is often due to a lack of training data.

Aleatory uncertainty arises from the random variability related to natural processes on the project - the statistical processes. Work durations, productivity, variance in quality. Epistemic uncertainty arises from the incomplete or imprecise nature of available information - the probabilistic assessment of when an event may occur.

**Variability Risk** (is the result of  “aleatoric uncertainty”): Alea in Aleatory is Latin and means dice. Aleatoric uncertainty comes from an inherent randomness, natural stochasticity, environmental or structural variation across space and time in the properties or behavior of the system under study. Here you know that something will definitely happen, but the uncertainty is in what the result will be. The accumulation of more data or additional information cannot reduce aleatory uncertainty.

Aleatory uncertainties can often be singled out from other uncertainties by their representation as distributed quantities that take on values in an established or known range. The exact values will vary by chance from unit to unit or time to time.

Typical examples of aleatory uncertainty include the outcomes of tossing dice and drawing cards from a shuffled pack. Aleatory uncertainty in projects may include: Unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase. The exchange rate could be much higher or lower when the material is delivered.
For variability risks, we cannot buy more information nor take specific risk reduction actions to reduce the uncertainty and resulting risk. The objective of identifying and managing variability risks is to be prepared to handle the impacts when risk is realized. The method for handling these impacts is to provide margin for this type of risk, including cost, schedule, and technical margin. Aleatoric uncertainty can be modeled in a Monte Carlo simulation tool. Here the range of variation is reflected in the probability distribution.

**Emergent Risk** (is the result of “Ontological Uncertainty): Uncertainty exist from what we don’t know—from our blind-spots. They arise from limitations in our conceptual frameworks or worldview. These are risks which we are unable to see because they are outside our experience or mindset, so we don’t know that we should be looking for them.
Another popular term for emergent risks is “the unknown unknowns,” which are things that we do not know but where we are unaware of our ignorance. In fact “unknown unknowns” can be divided into two types, one of which is a true emergent risk (“Black Swan”) and the other is not. These are:

The “unknown-but-knowable unknowns.” There are some uncertainties that we currently do not know, but which we could find out about. This is where the risk process can help, through creative risk identification, exploration, and education.
The “unknown-and-unknowable unknowns.” These are much more difficult to deal with, since by definition we can never discover them unless and until they happen. They are genuine emergent risks, which we could not predict with even the best risk process.

## The Economics Of Developing Software In Software Project Management

Software Economics in Software Engineering is a research area focusing on the challenges and issues associated with valuing software and determining or estimation costs usually involved in its production(_design, development, Implementation, testing and Maintenance among other things_). 
[Barry Boehm & Kevin J.Sullivan in Software Economics: A Roadmap](https://github.com/piusnmuhumuza/bootcamp/blob/master/Software%20Engineering/resources/softwareEconomics_ARoadMap-Boehm%20and%20Sullivan.pdf) outline these difficulties and challenges and also presented how software economics principles can be applied to improve software design, development, and evolution.

Software economics is basically situated at intersection of information economics and Software Engineering. 

Software engineering economics provides a way to examine the attributes of software and software processes in a systematic way that relates them to economic measures. These can be weighted and analyzed when making decisions within the scope of a software engineering project and its organization. The essence of software engineering economics is aligning software technical decisions with the business goals of the organization.

Most of software cost models are generally abstracted into function of five basic parameters being;-

* **Size –**
Size is generally measured or qualified in term of number of source instructions or in SLOC (Source line of code) or number of function points required to realize desired capabilities. The size of end product or result is required to develop or create required functionality.

* **Process –**
The process is steps that are used to guide all of activities and produce end products, in particular ability and capability of process to avoid or ignore activities that are not adding any value. It also supports heading towards the target or goal and eliminate activities that are not essential or important.

* **Personnel –**
The capabilities of personnel of software engineering in general, and particularly their experience with issues or problems regarding computer science and issues regarding application domain of project. It emphasizes on team and responsibilities of team.

* **Environment –**
It is simply made of various tools and techniques and automated procedures that are available and used to support software development and effort in an efficient way.

* **Quality –**
The required quality along with its features, performance, reliability, scalability, portability, usability, user interface utility, adaptability, and many more.

Between these parameters, relationship and estimated cost can be written in following way :

```code
Effort = (Personnel) (Environment) (Quality) (Size Process) 
```

## Introduction to Software Project Management

Software project management is the planning, managing and tracking of software development projects. While the deliverable might differ from other projects that produce tangible deliverables, the processes are basically the same as the management of any other type of project.

In Software development projects the software development life cycle (SDLC) process, often overlaps the traditional project management life cycle process and managed together for successful software development.

The Project Management Life Cycle will follow the typical;- _Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring and Control, Closing_ project life cycle phases while The Software Development Life Cycle will typically follow the ;- _Plan, Design, Implement, Test, Deploy, Maintain_ phases.

## Software projects versus other types of project

Many of the techniques of general project management are applicable to software project management, but software projects have certain characteristics that make them different.

The main difference between software and other enterprise projects is that software projects are not physical while others are.

The Characteristics of software projects that make them different from other types of projects include;-

1. Development Process
In software projects, the development process is iterative and involves a lot of testing, debugging, and refinement. On the other hand, other types of projects follow a more linear development process that includes designing, prototyping, testing, and manufacturing.

2. Invisibility
With software, progress is not immediately visible because the work is Logical, but the others structures such as bridges, work progress can be seen immediately. In software development, there is a level of uncertainty.

Detailed software project requirements are not easy to determine precisely before development begins. However, with the introduction of methodologies such as Agile and Scrum, we can overcome this limitation.

3. Complexity
Software projects are more complex than other engineering projects. For example, in a bridge, there is a clear structural relationship between parts, while the relationships between software components are much more complex. We cannot compare the complexity of software until we implement it.

4. Flexibility
A good point of software projects is that they are flexible. The client only wants the final result, so the rest is up to the programmer, who can modify the software at any stage.

While this is not the case with other projects because the client is exposed to everything in progress, he can see what the project manager and the team are working on, so it is not in the hands of the project team.

5. Customization
Software products can be easily customized and updated according to user needs, while other products may require more effort to customize or update.

6. Delivery
Software products can be delivered instantly over the Internet or by other electronic means, while other products require physical delivery, which can take longer.

7. Lifespan
Software products have a shorter lifespan than other products because they are often replaced by newer versions or better alternatives.

8. Cost
Software products are generally cheaper to produce and distribute than other products, which require more resources and materials.

9. Intellectual Property
Software products are more vulnerable to intellectual property theft and infringement because they can be easily copied and distributed, unlike other physically protected products.

10. Conformity
Physical systems are governed by consistent physical law, while Software developers have to conform to the requirements of human clients.

## Glossary

* **Software**

* **Projects**

* **Projects Management**

* **Demand versus supply.**  Demands and supplies are the fundamental behaviors of dynamic market systems, which form the context of economics.

* **Demand** is the required quantities for a product or service. It is also the demand for labor and materials needed to produce those products and services. Demand is a fundamental driving force of market systems and the predominant reason for most economic phenomena. The market response to a demand is called supply.  

* **Supply** is the required quantities for a product or service that producers are willing and able to sell at a given range of prices. This also extends to the labor and materials needed to produce the product and services to meet the demand.

* **Efficiency:** Efficiency of a system is generally defined as the ratio of its output to input. The efficiency can be classified into technical efficiency and economic efficiency.

* **Technical efficiency:** It is the ratio of the output to input of a physical system. The physical system may be a diesel engine, a machine working in a shop floor, a furnace, etc. (Technical efficiency (%) =  Output/ Input × 100)

* **Economic efficiency:** Economic efficiency is the ratio of output to input of a business system. (Economic efficiency (%) = Output/Input  × 100 = Worth/Cost × 100)

* **Investment:** Is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. (Interest = Current Value – Original Amount)

* **Loan:** Is money, property, or other material goods given to another party in exchange for future repayment of the loan value or principal amount, along with interest or finance charges. (Interest = Current Total Owed – Original Amount)

* **Rate of Return (ROR):** Interest accumulated per unit time. (ROR = Interest accumulated per unit time / Original Amount)

* **Time Value of Money (TVM):** Is the money available at the present time is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its potential earning capacity.

* **Present Value (PV):** Is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return.

* **Future Value (FV):** Is the value of a current asset at a future date based on an assumed rate of growth.

* * **Money value throughout time:** The time value of money draws from the idea that rational investors prefer to receive money today rather than the same amount of money in the future because of money’s potential to grow in value over a given period of time. For example, money deposited into a savings account earns a certain interest rate and is therefore said to be compounding in value.

* **Cash Flow:** Is the net amount of cash and cash-equivalents being transferred into and out of a business.

* **Interest:** is defined as the cost of borrowing money as in the case of interest charged on a loan balance.(Money paid for the use of money.) Interest can be calculated in two ways, simple interest or compound interest.

* **Simple interest** is calculated on the principal, or original, amount of a loan. Formula: Simple interest = P x i x n; P = principle, i = interest rate and n = term of the load

**Compound interest** is calculated on the principal amount and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods, and can thus be regarded as “interest on interest.” Formula: Compound interest= [P(1+i)^n]−P & Compound interest = P[(1+i)^n−1]; P = principle, i = interest rate in percentage terms and n = number of compounding periods of year.

* **Interest Rate:** Interest paid per unit time. (Interest Rate = Interest paid per unit time / Original Amount)
Interest rate is one of the most commonly used phrases in fixed-income investment lexicon. The different types of interest rates, including real, nominal, effective and annual, are distinguished by key economic factors, that can help individuals become smarter consumers and shrewder investors.

* **Nominal Interest Rate:** Is the stated interest rate of a bond or loan, which signifies the actual monetary price borrowers pay lenders to use their money.

**Effective Interest Rate:** Investors and borrowers should also be aware of the effective interest rate, which takes the concept of compounding into account. «Compounding is the process in which an asset’s earnings.

* **Opportunity Costs** are those cost resulting from the loss of potential gain from the other alternatives then the one alternative chosen by the decision maker. which is where making decisions in the Presence of Uncertainty comes in because making decision is about Opportunity Costs.

* **Software economics** deals with the application of economic principles to software development by focusing on the ever challenging issue of valuing software and estimating the costs involved in its production.

* **Software Engineering** is a technical discipline or approach that applies **computer science** and **engineering** concepts in the design, development, testing and maintenance of quality reliable, usable, and dependable software. Simply put, it's an engineering-based approach to software development.

* **Economics** is the study of how resources (people, time, facilities, money) are used to produce and distribute commodities and how services are provided in society. Economics is classified into microeconomics  and macroeconomics. — Microeconomics is the study of behaviors of individual agents and markets. Macroeconomics is the study of the broad aspects of the economy, for example employment, export, and prices on a national or global scope.

* **[Engineering Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_economics)** is a branch of microeconomics dealing with engineering related economic decisions and the application of economic principles and methods to engineering problems and decisions. It helps in evaluating the costs and benefits of different alternatives, such as projects, products, processes, or policies,in to make the best choice for your team, business or organization.

* **Software Engineering economics** is the application of economic techniques to the evaluation of Software design, development and engineering alternatives. It facilitates assessment of the appropriateness of a given software project, estimating its value, and justifying it from an business & engineering standpoint.

## Cost Estimation Models in Software Engineering

Cost estimation is a technique used to find out the cost estimates(_the financial spend that is done on the efforts to develop and test software_) of developing software.

Cost estimation models in Software Engineering are mathematical algorithms or parametric equations used to estimate the cost of a product or a project.

Most software cost models can be abstracted into a function of five basic parameters: size, process, personnel, environment, and required quality.

1. The size of the end product typically quantified in terms of the number of source instructions or the number of function points required to develop the required functionality.
2. The process used to produce the end product, in particular the ability of the process to avoid non-value-adding activities (rework, bureaucratic delays, communications overhead)
3. The capabilities of software engineering personnel, and particularly their experience with the computer science issues and the applications domain issues of the project
4. The environment, which is made up of the tools and techniques available to support efficient software development and to automate the process
5. The required quality of the product, including its features, performance, reliability, and adaptability

The relationships among these parameters and the estimated cost can be written as follows:

```code
Effort = (Personnel) (Environment) (Quality)(SizeProcess)
```

Several parametric models have been developed to estimate software costs; all of them can be generally abstracted into this form. One important aspect of software economics (as represented within today's software cost models) is that the relationship between effort and size exhibits a diseconomy of scale. The diseconomy of scale of software development is a result of the process exponent being greater than 1.0. Contrary to most manufacturing processes, the more software you build, the more expensive it is per unit item.
