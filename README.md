# Python Development

## Python & Django
Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language used to develop various desktop and mobile applications, websites, and software interfaces. Python developers use their programming and coding skills to combine software components and enhance features, data privacy, and security.

## Learning python
Python is a simple yet great programming language whose developers' versatility enables them to work on many tasks like;-
* Web Development
* Scripting
* Design Web Frameworks for new codes
* Automation
* Deployment Services
* Data Analysis
* Web Scraping

Although Python developers will typically do back-end/server-side development, work on coding, debugging errors, deploying services, and designing projects, the arrival of machine learning and data science has extended their reach.

Python developers can now perform a wide range of tasks with the work scope varying, depending on the needs of a company, employer or task at hand. Some Python developers are freelancers doing various tasks for different organizations and clients.

## Python Fundamentals to master when starting out.

1. Variables And Data Types.
2. Data Structures and Algorithms.
3. Loops, Conditional and Control Statements.
4. I/O Operations and Exception Handling.
5. Modules and File Handling.
6. Database Knowledge.

Python fundamentals are like a foundation for any programming language whose basic concepts developers starting out should master.

## Learn Supporting Frameworks and Technologies

one of the things to learn in Python after the fundamentals are **Python Frameworks** â€” toolkits developers can use to create software products quickly and efficiently. Using frameworks, python developers can focus on implementing application business logic without reinventing many common functions, including data storage, security layers, application routing, and many more. The two main types of frameworks are full-stack and microframeworks([reference](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/programming/how-to-become-a-python-developer)).

## Technical skills needed to become a competent Python developer;-

* Back-end and front-end Tools. front-end includes JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.
* Knowledge of Version control.
* A proper understanding of the automation framework for debugging errors, using different tools proficiently and managing other routine tasks thus managing toll and enhancing your speed and accuracy.
* A good grasp of Data Algorithms and Structures
