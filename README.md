# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING | A Business IT Engineering Collection

## Disclaimer

All material in this repository is attributed to a lot of research and curating while trying to improve my collective Technical skill set as both an Information and business Technology practitioner aiming to be a knowledgeable Technology Thought Leader.
Over the years, I've realized some of this information is not free in some places, hard to find quickly and hard to understand immediately and my own experiences have championed the creation of this repository.
I feel that my sharing can enable someone else to quickly gain insightful knowledge and also do the same for someone else.

Please read, use as a reference for further research, share, recommend and importantly suggest insights and resources for future improvements.
