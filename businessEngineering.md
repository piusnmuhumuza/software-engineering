# The Rise of Business Engineering

Important concepts in the field of Information Systems Technology, Business Engineering & Management


## Introduction

The field of Business Engineering (BE) developed primarily to fill the gap between the management and technical or administrative teams within a company by combining Business and Technology to solve problems.

Business engineering is a combination of business administration and technology specialization. In business engineering, you use business acumen and technology skills to develop, implement and maintain business technology databases, systems and frameworks for the company to use for success.

The goal of business engineering is to produce measurable results or quantifiable data rather than just an arbitrary improvement or change.

It on a holistic approach to problem solving. Rather than simply address different aspects of the business individually, business engineering professionals concentrate on the interaction between different factors within the company and how they impact one another.

Business Engineering field is that it can be applied to a company at any stage of development and act as a means of generating continuous improvement.

Business engineering (BE) is the development and implementation of business solutions, from business model to business processes and organizational structure to information systems and information technology

Business engineering focuses on developing innovative business solutions that take a sociotechnical systems (STS) approach. The STS approach addresses an enterprise as a total system in the same manner as an airplane system or an industrial facility, since they possess a similar level of complexity.

Business engineering combines knowledge in the fields of business administration, Industrial Engineering, as well as information technology and connects it to all aspects of transformation, from means of presentation to process models to cultural and political considerations.

A person is referred to as a Business Engineer when the person is a hybrid between an entrepreneur and an engineer. They must possess the understanding of how the business world operates at both macro and micro levels and be able to come up with solutions based on various key elements.

The Business life model, an example of business engineering, is a tool created to help entrepreneurs, business people and academics build stronger business models.

Business engineering focuses on challenges arising from the that is the digitization of enterprises, economy, administration and society. Through the ongoing consumerization digital services for individuals have also become a crucial part of research.

Engineering Management is a very close discipline which overlaps significantly with Business Engineering; the main differences are that Industrial Engineering focuses primarily on the goods sector (less on services), on technical systems and the interface between those systems as well as the users from a production point of view.

**Engineering Management**

Engineering management is the application of engineering methods, tools, and techniques to business management systems, bringing together the technological problem-solving ability of engineering and the organizational, administrative, legal and planning abilities of management in order to oversee the operational performance of complex engineering-driven enterprises.

**Subject areas covered by Business Engineering**

**Business Analysis**

Business Analysis can be generally described as a research discipline that helps you to define and validate solutions that meets business needs, goals, or objectives. The main purpose of business analysis is to identify solutions that meet the need for improvement. These solutions may include the development of a software or system component, improvements in process, organizational changes or strategic planning and policy development.

**Business process reengineering (BPR) / Business Process Improvement (BPI)**

Business process reengineering is a method used to improve the performance of any business by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of processes that exist across the business.

**Business Process Reengineering steps include,**

1. Define Business Processes
2. Analyse Business Processes.
3. Identify and Analyse Improvement Opportunities.
4. Design Future State Processes.
5. Develop Future State Changes
6. Implement Future State Changes.

**Some of the Business Process Reengineering methodologies**

1. Hammer / Champy Methodology
2. Davenport Methodology
3. Manganelli / Klein Methodology

They helps in bringing the change to any business process.

**Business Engineering**

Business Engineering includes knowledge of business administration, technology (engineering) and information technology (IT) and applies it to create business models which take into account some technical and economic aspects as well as organizational, cultural and even political ones.

Business Engineering as a trans-disciplinary field of knowledge, including design, implementation and management of integrated anthropo-technical systems, with particular emphasis put on the organizational aspects and information technology.

Beside the technical design, business engineering includes the political and cultural dimensions of a new business solution. The political and cultural dimensions and change management are crucial factors for the success or failure of a transformation. Therefore, business engineering is an interdisciplinary approach. It divides the design levels of a company.

Business engineering distinguishes between a strategic, an organizational and a technological design level. Contemplating different design objects on different levels enables a focused view of the individual dimensions of transformation (,[9] S. 191). Segmenting task at hand into different levels provides for security and helps reducing the complexity of the transformation process.

Business engineering ensures a holistic view of all dimensions. It supports not only the design of new business models, business processes and information systems, but also their implementation. Therefore, it contemplates all dimensions (resources and processes involved) of the transformation.

Business engineering refers to the method and model-based design theory for companies in the information age (,[4] S. 7). Business transformations along with their technical and socio-economic aspects are far too important and complex to be realized without applying methods and models. Methods and models not only provide for transparency during the process of transformation, they also specify the division of labor, create a foundation for communication and enable the documentation of the company's systematic reorientation. The division of labor and application of engineering principles differentiate the "construction" in accordance with business engineering from individualistic "creation" (cf.,[4] S. 88).

Business engineering focuses on the consumer from a business perspective. As of now, this also holds true for the deep penetration of all spheres of private life with information technology (consumerization), which is equally being treated from a business and not an individual point of view.

The basic methods of research in the field of Business Engineering are: a systems and process approach, as well as modelling and simulation of the business processes.

This approach is based on the innovative management transformation, using integrated methods from other disciplines, such as:

- systems engineering,
- IT technology and innovation,
- strategic management,
- risk management,
- quality management, and
- organizational design (human factors).
- Management science
- Business administration
- Law and economics
- Technology and engineering

The traditional engineering disciplines such as mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering, etc. refer to physical objects that are visible and generally easy for modelling.

Some of the key elements comprising business engineering require a deep understanding of several disciplines and areas:

- Business model
- Business processes
- Organizational structure
- Digitalization
- Information process and technologies
- The interaction between people and technologies within organizations

As more businesses incorporate technology and lean toward digitalization, the discipline of business engineering becomes more important and prevalent in the business world. The discipline concerns the following aspects of a company:

- Technology
- Business model
- Organizational structure
- Economics
- Information technology
- Information processing
- Digitalization
- Engineering
- Administration
- Management

Any organization can be modelled as a complex structure (_e.g., network_) with a system of interactions of a cause-effect chains, feedbacks and other external influences (_e.g., threats and disturbances_) and **Business Engineering** tools allow to establish better understanding and management of organizations by the searching for rational strategy and responding to questions, such as e.g.

- What is broken in your organization?
- Are you aware of it?
- Which things need to be fixed first?
- How do you prioritize changes or improvements?
- What are the long-term impacts of current problems and initiatives?
- How do you respond to changing external and internal forces?
- How do you leverage the installed base of information technology (IT), and get the most out of this new technology?
- What should we do in employee training and recruitment?

Business engineers should have skills enabling them to assess following business potential of IT innovations, create strategic visions, analyze and redesign business processes, plan and control transformation projects, and get people actively involved in transformation processes.

**What Is A Business Engineer**

A Business Engineer is a hybrid between a business administration and technology expert, a person with the business acumen and engineering abilities to understand a complex organization and devise solutions and work as a liaison between commercial and technical teams.

A business engineer is a hybrid between a business person and an engineer. The business engineer is someone with the understanding of how the business world works ad macro level, combined with how organisms' function at a micro level, that can architecture solutions based on several key elements.

Business Engineers develop solutions by identifying complex processes and optimizing them where needed with the right tools, skills, and support.

A business engineer is a manager that can guide companies through hard decisions by looking at quantitative data, navigating ambiguity and reducing the noise where needed.

A business engineer is a hybrid between a commercial and technical role. It can work as a liaison between commercial and technical teams to device complex solutions to its organizations or other companies for which the business engineer partners with.

Business engineers typically perform a variety of different functions in their daily work, including teaching others to use technology systems and databases and also work closely with IT & Management departments, and any technical partners a company may have to design technology-based systems for efficiency in the workplace.

**What do business engineers do?**

Business engineers typically have a variety of responsibilities in their daily roles. The specific tasks and projects may vary from company to company and may change as different needs arise or may become more specialized, depending on your specific focus or specialization in business. Here are a few common job responsibilities that business engineers have:

- Designing technology-based systems for specific business needs
- Developing software, programs and databases
- Collecting and analyzing business data
- Utilizing business intelligence software to conduct their work
- Managing technology updates throughout a company
- Training staff to use technology
- Developing software validation methods
- Troubleshooting issues within technology or administration aspects of a company
- Giving presentations on their designs and developments
- Providing technical support
- Synthesizing and modeling data
- Meeting with clients to determine their business needs and wants
- Documenting software updates
- Overseeing quality control and performance levels

**Business Skills Every Engineer Needs**

**Cores Business Engineer Skills**

Typically, business engineers share similar skill sets that allow them to succeed in their roles. By acquiring essential business and technology skills, Business Engineers can better equip themselves to meet changing workforce demands and gain a competitive edge when solving business technology-related problems.

These skills generally include the following:

**Attention to detail**

Business engineers are typically hyper-focused and pay great attention to detail when it comes to their work. In this role, you may read through important reports and documents, as well as work on complex projects and tasks every day. Having the ability to pay close attention to all details involved in these tasks is extremely important to succeeding in the role.

**Research and critical thinking**

**Problem-solving**

As a business engineer, it's common for problem-solving to be an everyday occurrence in the workplace. Being able to analyze issues or challenges you or the company you work for faces, finding solutions and implementing them in a timely manner is common. In this role, it's generally necessary that you're able to detect potential issues and fix them before they have the chance to have a larger impact on your work.

**Communication (Written & Verbal)**

**Written communication**

Having strong written communication skills is also very important for a business engineer. Being able to craft detailed, accessible and easily readable documents and reports regarding your work is necessary for clients and coworkers being able to understand your work and how it's used. Having the ability to write up clear, concise and informative texts is critical in this role.

**Verbal communication**

Being able to speak clearly and professionally is a skill that business engineers typically have. Communicating ideas, concepts and theories, as well as information regarding your daily work, is especially important in business engineering jobs. Communicating verbally with coworkers, staff members and clients is common in this role and being able to do so in a manner that's understandable is typically a good skill to have as a business engineer.

**Technology fluency**

Many business engineers are experts in technology. Utilizing different types of devices, such as computers, phones and tablets, as well as software, mobile applications and programs that sort, organize and run business data, is common for these types of professionals who need Technology and computer science skills. In this role, it's important to be as up-to-date as possible with any new technology news, products, software and programs as they relate to your work.

**Business operations**

refers to everything a company does to remain profitable. Business Engineers can contribute to the efforts of a company or business growth by having a good understanding of business operations to be able to measure their work's impact on revenue, control project costs, and better understand their organization's overall budget while coming up with solutions to existing and new problems.

**Leadership**

Leadership is an essential business skill for high-level engineers. It's particularly important considering the emergence of artificial intelligence in the technology sector, which has led to an increased number of complex ethical questions being posed to engineering leadership, such as: What biases are there in algorithms, and how transparent are they?

Engineers build products and services that can directly impact society. As a result, engineering leaders must clearly understand ethical implications in the industry. They should approach each problem with integrity and do what's right for their business. This requires leadership skills and an agile leadership methodology that allows them to quickly and efficiently adapt to a constantly evolving landscape.

In addition to ethical responsibilities, developing a strong leadership style is crucial to effective leadership. To retain employees, satisfy customers, and improve productivity, engineering leaders must communicate their firms' visions, guide teams, and influence change management.

**Management**

For prospective engineering managers, it's important to have a grasp of management essentials. Understanding what motivates colleagues and knowing how to exercise influence, effectively implement strategies, and develop learning initiatives that help their organizations innovate are skills that can take a business Engineer's career to the next level.

Considering the profession's earning potential, management skills are vital and therefore, gaining expertise in management can significantly boost a Business engineers experience and earnings.

**Business engineer education and background**

Business Engineers often share similar education and background, but will typically have a minimum of certifications, a bachelor's degree, though a master's degree and working experience in some case, in one of the following disciplines: - _Business administration, Information Technology, Finance, Business, Management, Engineering, Information systems/Information systems management, Accounting, Computer science_

**Keywords**

Business Engineering, Management Science, Business Administration, Law, Enterprise Architecture, Economics, Technology, Engineering, Engineering Management, Business Processes, Business Models, Business Analysis, Technology based-Systems.

**# Enterprise Architecture**

Enterprise Architecture(EA) is an important discipline, as organizations need to understand the fundamental aspects of their business in order to keep pace with the global market and technology changes in a continually evolving world.

Enterprise architecture (EA) is a business function concerned with the structures and behaviors of a business, especially business roles and processes that create and use business data. With Enterprise Architecture(EA) you learn how to model an Enterprise using TOGAF, including working with the Architecture Development Method (ADM) and metamodel attributes.

Enterprise architecture applies architecture principles and practices to guide organizations through the business, information, process, and technology changes necessary to execute their strategies. These practices utilize the various aspects of an enterprise to identify, motivate, and achieve these changes."

## Introduction

As a discipline, EA "proactively and holistically lead[s] enterprise responses to disruptive forces by identifying and analyzing the execution of change" towards organizational goals. EA gives business and IT leaders recommendations for policy adjustments and provides best strategies to support and enable business development and change within the information systems the business depends on. EA provides a guide for decision making towards these objectives.[5] The National Computing Centre's EA best practice guidance states that an EA typically "takes the form of a comprehensive set of cohesive models that describe the structure and functions of an enterprise. The individual models in an EA are arranged in a logical manner that provides an ever-increasing level of detail about the enterprise."

**Origins of enterprise architecture**

The first publication to use the exact term enterprise architecture was a National Institute of Standards Special Publication[1] on the challenges of information system integration. The overview states "This panel addressed the role of architectures and standards in support of management throughout an enterprise."

This original use is often incorrectly attributed to John Zachman's 1987 paper,[2] which did not use the term "Enterprise Architecture". The scope of the report by the NIST "enterprise architecture" panel may be directly compared to Zachman's current thinking presented in the 1987 article which is as follows: "With increasing size and complexity of the Implementations of Information systems it Is necessary to use some logical construct (or architecture) for defining and controlling the interfaces and the Integration of all of the components of the system. The discussion is limited to architecture and does not include a strategic planning methodology."

## The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)

[The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Open\_Group\_Architecture\_Framework) is a framework in enterprise architecture that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise information technology architecture.

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is one of the most widely accepted methods for developing enterprise architecture. It's a high-level approach to design typically modeled at four levels: \_Business, Application, Data, and Technology\_. and relies heavily on modularization, standardization, and already existing, proven technologies and products.

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)

[The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)](https://handwiki.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework) (cf. Weinberger[[14]](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Finance:Business_engineering#cite_note-Weinberger_2010-14)) presents a structure for organizational architectures which offers a holistic approach to designing, planning, implementing and maintaining information architectures and, thus, covers an important section, albeit not the entire scope, of BE. When applying TOGAF, the [enterprise architecture](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture) is usually modelled in the three domains: [business architecture](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Finance:Business_architecture), information systems architecture (consisting of application architecture and [data architecture](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Data_architecture)), and technology architecture.It is the most used framework for [enterprise architecture](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture) as of 2020[[2]](https://handwiki.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework#cite_note-2) that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise information technology architecture.[[3]](https://handwiki.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework#cite_note-3) TOGAF is a high-level approach to design. It is typically modeled at four levels: Business, Application, Data, and Technology. It relies heavily on modularization, standardization, and already existing, proven technologies and products.

TOGAF was developed starting 1995 by [The Open Group](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Company:The_Open_Group), based on United States Department of Defense's TAFIM and [Capgemini](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Company:Capgemini)'s Integrated Architecture Framework (IAF).[[4]](https://handwiki.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework#cite_note-4) As of 2016, The Open Group claims that TOGAF is employed by 80% of Global 50 companies and 60% of [_Fortune 500_](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%20500) companies.

**History**

TOGAF was initiated in the early 1990s as methodology for the development of technical architecture, and has been developed by [The Open Group](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Company:The_Open_Group) into an extensive enterprise architecture framework.[[7]](https://handwiki.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework#cite_note-7) In 1995, the first version of TOGAF (TOGAF 1.0) was presented. This version was mainly based on the Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM), development started in the late 1980s by the US Department of Defense.
