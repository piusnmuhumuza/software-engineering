# **THE COMPLETE MARKDOWN GUIDE:** 
## **A reference guide to all the Markdown syntax**
This is simple guide i put together while learning Markdown Syntax. it's an overview of all the Markdown syntax both Basic & Github Flavored to help developers or technical Authors to write better software documentation, Markdown academic documents and other Technical Writing endeavour.

### **Background**
In 2019 i took on a job as an Andriod Developer. I didn't know much but during that period up until mid 2021, i learned about Mobile development projects, DevOps, Project Management, how to us Github and Technical Writing. I also got an idea of which Roadmaps to follow as a Mobile Developer, Web Developer, Data Scientist or Project Manager.

To improve my Technical Authoring skills, i decide to master the Markdown syntax and this document is my humble contribution thanks to a number of references.

### **So What is Markdown?**
Before we start learning anything, we must know what it is. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that we can use to add formatting to a plain-text document on the web. We can transform the text to italic, bold, or underlined and we can create lists, links, and heading using alpha-numeric characters like ‘*’ and ‘#’. Sometimes, we also use markdown as a utility to convert the files into HTML(Hyper-text markup language).

It was developed by **John Gruber** in **2004** and is almost the world’s most popular markup language. Markdown is often used to format README.md files, for writing messages in the online discussion forums, and to create rich posts, Like In Dev. to, you can only write and format posts using markdown. 

Check out my [README](https://github.com/piusmnwilson/markdown/blob/main/README.md) for an explaination of what a readme file is. 

This file is a modified version of my initial [markdownCheatsheet](https://github.com/piusmnwilson/markdown/blob/main/markdownCheatsheet.md) file
