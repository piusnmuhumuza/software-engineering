# Normalisation

Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations. Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion, and update anomalies. So, it helps to minimize the redundancy in relations. Normal forms are used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables.

## Normalization of DBMS

In database management systems (DBMS), normal forms are a series of guidelines that help to ensure that the design of a database is efficient, organized, and free from data anomalies. There are several levels of normalization, each with its own set of guidelines, known as normal forms.

### Important Points Regarding Normal Forms in DBMS

* **First Normal Form (1NF):** This is the most basic level of normalization. In 1NF, each table cell should contain only a single value, and each column should have a unique name. The first normal form helps to eliminate duplicate data and simplify queries.
* **Second Normal Form (2NF):** 2NF eliminates redundant data by requiring that each non-key attribute be dependent on the primary key. This means that each column should be directly related to the primary key, and not to other columns.
* **Third Normal Form (3NF):** 3NF builds on 2NF by requiring that all non-key attributes are independent of each other. This means that each column should be directly related to the primary key, and not to any other columns in the same table.
* **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):** BCNF is a stricter form of 3NF that ensures that each determinant in a table is a candidate key. In other words, BCNF ensures that each non-key attribute is dependent only on the candidate key.
* **Fourth Normal Form (4NF):** 4NF is a further refinement of BCNF that ensures that a table does not contain any multi-valued dependencies.
* **Fifth Normal Form (5NF):** 5NF is the highest level of normalization and involves decomposing a table into smaller tables to remove data redundancy and improve data integrity.


Normal forms help to reduce data redundancy, increase data consistency, and improve database performance. However, higher levels of normalization can lead to more complex database designs and queries. It is important to strike a balance between normalization and practicality when designing a database

### Advantages of Normal Form

* Reduced data redundancy: Normalization helps to eliminate duplicate data in tables, reducing the amount of storage space needed and improving database efficiency.
* Improved data consistency: Normalization ensures that data is stored in a consistent and organized manner, reducing the risk of data inconsistencies and errors.
* Simplified database design: Normalization provides guidelines for organizing tables and data relationships, making it easier to design and maintain a database.
* Improved query performance: Normalized tables are typically easier to search and retrieve data from, resulting in faster query performance.
* Easier database maintenance: Normalization reduces the complexity of a database by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tables, making it easier to add, modify, and delete data.

Overall, using normal forms in DBMS helps to improve data quality, increase database efficiency, and simplify database design and maintenance.

### Applications of Normal Forms in DBMS

* **Data consistency:** Normal forms ensure that data is consistent and does not contain any redundant information. This helps to prevent inconsistencies and errors in the database.
* **Data redundancy:** Normal forms minimize data redundancy by organizing data into tables that contain only unique data. This reduces the amount of storage space required for the database and makes it easier to manage.
* **Response time:** Normal forms can improve query performance by reducing the number of joins required to retrieve data. This helps to speed up query processing and improve overall system performance.
* **Database maintenance:** Normal forms make it easier to maintain the database by reducing the amount of redundant data that needs to be updated, deleted, or modified. This helps to improve database management and reduce the risk of errors or inconsistencies.
* **Database design:** Normal forms provide guidelines for designing databases that are efficient, flexible, and scalable. This helps to ensure that the database can be easily modified, updated, or expanded as needed.

### Some Important Points about Normal Forms

* BCNF is free from redundancy caused by Functional Dependencies.
* If a relation is in BCNF, then 3NF is also satisfied.
* If all attributes of relation are prime attribute, then the relation is always in 3NF.
* A relation in a Relational Database is always and at least in 1NF form.
* Every Binary Relation ( a Relation with only 2 attributes ) is always in BCNF.
* If a Relation has only singleton candidate keys( i.e. every candidate key consists of only 1 attribute), then the Relation is always in 2NF( because no Partial functional dependency possible).
* Sometimes going for BCNF form may not preserve functional dependency. In that case go for BCNF only if the lost FD(s) is not required, else normalize till 3NF only.
* There are many more Normal forms that exist after BCNF, like 4NF and more. But in real world database systems itâ€™s generally not required to go beyond BCNF.

## Conclusion

In Conclusion, relational databases can be arranged according to a set of rules called normal forms in database administration (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, and 5NF), which reduce data redundancy and preserve data integrity. By resolving various kinds of data anomalies and dependencies, each subsequent normal form expands upon the one that came before it.
