# Software Testing

## Breakdown Software Testing



#### Software Testing Typically falls under 3 categories; -

* Functional Testing: A type of software testing that validates the software against a list of requirements or specifications. These tests aim to assess each application function and mainly involve black box testing. Functional testing analyses details like user interface, database, security, application programming interfaces (APIs), and client/server communication. Functional Testing will usually have _Unit testing, Integration testing, System testing, Interface testing, Regression testing, Beta/acceptance testing_

* Non-Functional Testing: Sometimes called performance testing, this method focuses on testing an application for its non-functional elements and requirements. Non-functional elements encompass things like performance, reliability, and usability. An example of a test would be checking how many users can be logged into a tool simultaneously without the tool lagging or glitching. Test carried out here often include _Performance testing, Load testing, Stress testing, Volume testing, Security testing, Compatibility testing, Install testing, Recovery testing, Reliability testing, Usability testing, Compliance testing_.

* Maintenance Testing: A method of software testing that aims to uncover software errors or bugs within a program after changes have been made. It retests the program to ensure that after the changes are complete, the changes don’t negatively impact the features within the code or conflict with necessary requirements. Test carried out in Maintenance Testing include Regression testing, confirmation testing.

### Levels of Testing

The different levels of software testing explore the four software testing levels that take place during the development lifecycle with each level conducted thoroughly, checking for something different—nothing should be rushed or skipped.
These are; —

#### Unit Testing

This is usually done at the code level, testing individual parts or components (units) of a software to analyse their functionality and ensure each piece of the software functions correctly on its own and works as intended.

#### Integration Testing

Is the process of testing how different units or components work together when integrated into a larger system to check if the combined units cooperate as expected and don't cause issues when connected. It enables software testers to test units of software when integrated into a whole system to identify any bugs or issues arising from integrations between modules. It is possible to automate integration testing.

#### System Testing

This is the process of testing the entire system (an integrated environment comprising the whole application), where all components are assessed against specific business requirements to verify that it meets the specified requirements, and ensure the complete software system functions correctly and satisfies user needs. Automation tools can be used for System Testing.

#### Acceptance Testing

This is where a team checks if the software meets the requirements and specifications set by the end-users or clients to confirm that the software is ready for release and satisfies the user's expectations and needs. Acceptance testing involves testing the system’s Functional and Non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, usability, accessibility, compatibility, and reliability. Depending on the system’s complexity, it can be done manually or through automation tools.
