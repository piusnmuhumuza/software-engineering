## ## Introduction

When it comes to the development, maintenance and continuous improvement of a software product, Quality Assurance (QA) making sure everything goes according to plan while Software Testing can be looked at as a subset of QA that analyses the software product to find flaws to be fixed and guarantee its usability, dependability, and performance.

Software Testing is one of the parts of the software development life cycle

A Quality Assurance (QA) process is a key element in the Software Development Lifecycle where a software product is tested to ensure it meets set standards, requirements, and customer expectations.
 A typical QA process would include; - _requirements analysis, test planning, test cases design, running test cases and bugs reporting, performing regression testing after bug fixing and finally running release tests_ depending on the team or organisation. It is more like merging Software Test Life Cycle (STLC) with Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

For consistent continuous improvement in Software Quality Assurance processes, a QA Methodology defined cycle known as PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle is often used.

This documentation will provide in-depth knowledge about Software Testing, the various Types of Software Testing and how it relates to Software Quality Assurance and the Software Development Lifecycle in Software Engineering.

## Is Software Quality Assurance and Software Testing the same?

While Software Quality Assurance and Software Testing are used interchangeably in the Software Engineering/Development space, and both aim to provide software that meets the necessary requirements and quality standards, they aren't exactly the same.

SQA stretches through all software development phases depending on the team, industry, or practices being followed and should not be confused with software testing. -Testing is a big part of Software Quality Assurance, but it is not, by any means, the only part of it.

Software testing concentrates on finding the bugs, defects, and errors within the software, while Software Quality Assurance aims to assure that the overall quality of the software product being engineered/developed meets the requirements and expectations of the client.
