# DPIMS | Digital Projects Information Management System

Since every project is unique, this is a simple and easily customizable PM system for project planning, resource allocation, tracking of project components, and change management among other things to track projects, including milestones, tasks, hours, costs, deadlines, project human capital and more.

DPIMS is the systematic process of creating, identifying, collecting, organizing, sharing, adapting, and using project information to deliver on-time, on-budget, and in-scope results for projects. DPIMS facilitates a process of project Information management for identifying all the information the project stakeholders need to make informed decisions when managing project small or large.

## An Introduction to Project Management

Before we get into the Projects Information Management System, Let's get some background understanding on project management.

### What is a project?

A project is a time-limited effort that, if completed successfully, will create something new and valuable.

project management can mean building roads or cities, developing new software, defining new methodologies, etc. All of these imply that the project will deliver something completely new (or an improved version of something else).

### What is project management?

Project management is the process of accomplishing a predefined goal within a set time period and budget. It requires a varied group of techniques, skills, and tools.

During the project management cycle, we’ll create and implement a plan for our project. We’ll track progress throughout. In some cases, we’ll have to make changes to cope with unplanned situations and events. If that happens, we’ll need to reallocate resources to critical activities and tasks in order to stay on schedule; in a worst-case scenario, we may have to alter our project plan.

In a perfect world, we could deliver project results on time, on budget and with the right quality. In real life, we need to balance scheduling, budgeting and quality during the entire process.

## Project Information

Project information is a strategic resource that must be managed with the same rigor as financial and physical resources. Project managers need to improve the way they manage their information, by bringing the right information to the right people at the right time. It is through project information management that they can
improve their decision-making process, learn, and create new knowledge.

### What are some project management terms I need to know?

There are a few popular project management approaches (Lean, PRINCE2, process-based, traditional, etc.) but we won’t go into these now. I’ll stick to the terms that are common in most project management methodologies. Some of these terms are:

* **Project stakeholders** – All private individuals or business entities that are interested in the successful finishing of the projects. This includes the clients or sponsors of the project, but it can also include user groups, government agencies, and people who work on the project, among many others.
Project manager – The person in charge of planning, executing, and closing the project. Project managers should be properly educated in the field; they should also be able to use various techniques and tools to fulfill their role.
* **Activity** – A single action that produces a “small” result. An activity is usually related to other activities. Some can run simultaneously and independently of each other; others must wait until some previous activity is completed. For example, ordering needed software is an activity.
* **Task** – A group of related activities that produces a “larger” result. If we complete all project tasks successfully, we’ll also close our project successfully. So, after the ordered software is delivered (1st activity of the task) we can install it (2nd activity on the same task) and see if it works as expected (3rd activity). Once we’ve completed all these activities, we’ve also completed this task.
* **Critical path** – A sequence of related activities that have no time buffer. If any activity on that path requires more time than allotted to it, we’ll need to respond in some way. This could mean modifying our plan, reallocating resources, decreasing quality, or extending the whole project.
* **Gantt chart** – A graphical representation that is often used to track project progress. The Gantt chart clearly displays all tasks, activities, planned resources and budgets, activity and task statuses, critical paths etc. The X-axis is the time axis (usually measured in weeks) and the Y-axis shows the project tasks and activities.
  
### What should project management software look like?

Project management software should be as simple as possible. It would be best to have the entire Gantt chart on one screen. We can expect that we’ll still need to scroll to see various parts, but we’ll have everything clearly visible on a single screen.

## Digital Projects Information Management System(DPIMS)

PIMS is an IT centered project management platform for planning client projects, tracking of project components, resource allocation, and change management.

### Primary Building Blocks of Wakmasta (primary functions)

**Project planning:** To define a project schedule, a project manager may use the software to map project tasks and visually describe task interactions.

**Task management:** Allows the project manager to create and assign tasks, establish deadlines, and produce status reports.

**Resource management:** Defines responsibilities – who is supposed to do what.
Budgeting and cost tracking: A good project management application facilitates budget reporting as well as viewing, notifying, and updating costs for stakeholders.

**Time tracking:** The software must have the ability to track time spent on all tasks and maintain records for third-party consultants.
