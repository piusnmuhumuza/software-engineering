# Project Management

If your organization is running many projects at the same time it can become challenging to manage or to make the right decisions if all projects are isolated. Therefore managing projects in logical groups and with good project information to use resources efficiently and effectively can be beneficial to the organisation. 

In some establishments they will have dedicated Project Management Offices(PMOs). The distribution of projects under a program or portfolio depends on the nature and the type of project. Products if part of an organisation's business model can be organized under projects. Programs are managed through program management and portfolios are managed through portfolio management.

## Introduction

A product is the value proposition/any item/'what you sell to serve a customer's need or want. A project is focused on creating a unique product, service, or result. A program is a collection of projects that need to be managed and coordinated together. And, a portfolio is a collection of projects and programs that are managed as a group to achieve strategic goals and a business value.

At any given time, a business establishment or organization is running several projects funded by different stakeholder pools. In small organizations, or by individual project managers,projects will often be handled on a first-come-first-served basis, better paying project, best fit or based on who makes the most noise.

But as organizations grow or get more projects, there comes the point where it becomes necessary to prioritize and manage the range of projects with a strategical approach.

There is often confusion when it comes to defining projects, programs, and portfolios. Sometimes a program is called a project, and sometimes a project is called a program. Sometimes project portfolios and programs are mistakenly used interchangeably. These three components require quite different strategies to manage them successfully.

## Project

A project is the lowest level in the hierarchy of project, program, portfolio, and organization. And Products are organized under projects.

According to the PMBOK Guide, _“A project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.”_ therefore once the project achieves its objective, it no longer exists, and the objective of the project is to create a unique product, or develop a system to provide you with a service or the result.
As an undertaking that starts and ends in a given time frame, focusing on producing a specific output in the form of pre-established deliverables, A Project will have certain defining characteristics e.g unique, specific, purposeful, and time-bound.

While the specifics of each endeavor are unique, projects consist of some important certain elements shared commonly like;-

Goals, Success criteria, Requirements,Team,Scope of work,Budget,Resources, and a Schedule and without these aspects, it would be difficult to monitor progress, estimate workload and timelines, calculate the costs, or verify the outcome, among other things.

Consequently, businesses/organisations/freelance project managers often adopt different ways of approaching project management, also known as project management methodologies and the choice of methodology, each having different rules, processes, and tools.

Project management is the application of people, process, technology, knowledge, and skills to achieve successful completion of specific project goals and objectives therefore good project management means teams and team members are constantly developing and improving, giving the business a competitive advantage.

## Program

A program is a group of related projects and program activities managed to contribute to the same business objective or benefit. The program as a whole has clearly defined goals, and each project within the program assists in meeting those goals.

The main traits that all programs share;_Large, Long-term, General, and Strategic._

Program management give your organization the ability to align multiple projects for optimized or integrated costs, schedule, effort, and benefits.

Program managers look at cross-project dependencies, risks, issues, requirements, and solutions, and may coordinate with individual project managers to achieve these insights and keep the overall program healthy. They’re less concerned with the success of every single individual project, and more focused on the success of the overall initiative and achieving the larger benefit.

Program managers are also concerned with making sure the right projects are chosen or prioritized in order to achieve the most business value. Successful programs work towards improvements that will have a long-term impact on your organization, and unlike projects that have a specific end date, programs may be ongoing initiatives.

## Portfolio

Portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, and sub-portfolios or operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives. All these items may not necessarily be interdependent or directly related. Simply put, a portfolio is a set of various initiatives under a single umbrella.

Portfolio management provides a big picture of your organization's projects and programs and supports leadership to analyse and make the right decisions.

Managing a portfolio is a continuous process as it pertains to all the objectives of a business, incoming programs and projects are included in the portfolio as they appear thus a portfolio’s elements must align with the business’s long-term strategy and objectives.

According to PMBOK Guide, by PMI, Portfolio Management aligns with organizational strategies by selecting the right programs or projects, prioritizing the work, and providing the needed resources.

The four goals of portfolio management are:

1) Maximizing the value of your portfolio
2) Seeking the right balance of projects
3) Creating a strong link to your strategy
4) Doing the right number of projects.

Project management is about executing projects right, while portfolio management is about executing the right projects. It is a way to bridge the gap between strategy and execution.

## Strategy

As stated before, a portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, and sub-portfolios, managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives. So it comes naturally that for each strategy there exists a portfolio to achieve this strategy. Therefore, if you only have one strategy you should manage all your projects in one portfolio.
