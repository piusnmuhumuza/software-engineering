[2] **Task management:** Allows the project manager to create and assign tasks, establish deadlines, and produce status reports.

[3] **Resource management:** Defines responsibilities â€“ who is supposed to do what.

[4] **Budgeting and cost tracking:** facilitates budget reporting as well as viewing, notifying, and updating costs for stakeholders.
