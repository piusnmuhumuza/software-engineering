# User Psychology

The term “user psychology” was first coined in the early 2000s to describe the application of psychological principles to technology and user interfaces. Since then, it has evolved to encompass a broader range of activities such as designing for mobile phones and other handheld devices, developing online services, and creating virtual environments.

## What exactly is User Psychology

User Psychology is the study of how users interact with and respond to various products and services. It examines how users perceive, remember, and process information, as well as the factors that influence their behaviors.

> "_Everything that can happen in a user’s mind is important when they use your design. And a few things before that. And a few after._" — [Chapter 12. What Is User Psychology?](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ux-for-beginners/9781491912676/ch12.html)

Understanding user psychology can be a powerful tool for creating better products and services, as it allows us to design solutions that are tailored to users’ needs and preferences.

User Psychology studies how people think, act, and feel while they use digital products, services, and systems by focusing on understanding the motivations, intentions, behaviors, and reactions of users when interacting with products and services.

The goal is to understand what factors can influence the user’s decision-making process in order to make the products & services they interact with easier to use and more enjoyable.

User psychology's interdisciplinary approach that combines various disciplines such as psychology, sociology, anthropology, communication science, design, marketing, and artificial intelligence among others helps designers create better products and services by taking into account the user’s needs and preferences.
