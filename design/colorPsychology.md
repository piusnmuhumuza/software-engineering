# Color Psychology

[Color psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_psychology) is the study of how certain colors &  hues impact & determine human behavior. Color influences perceptions that are not obvious, such as the taste of food. 


Different colors have different meanings, connotations, and psychological effects that vary across different cultures and certain qualities that can cause certain emotions in people. Along with cultural differences, color psychology is largely impacted by personal preference.

_How color influences individuals may differ depending on age, gender, and culture.[2] Although color associations can vary contextually between cultures, color preference is thought to be relatively uniform across gender and race.[3]_

_Color psychology is also widely used in marketing and branding. Marketers see color as an important factor, since color can influence a consumers' emotions and perceptions about goods and services.[4] Logos for companies are important, since the logos can attract more customers._

The field of color psychology applies to many other domains such as medical therapy, sports, hospital settings, and even in game design. 

## A Brief History of Color Psychology

Before there was color psychology as a field, color was being used for centuries as a method of treatment as early as 2000 BC. The ancient Egyptians documented color "cures" using painted rooms or sunlight shining through crystals as therapy.

During the late seventeenth century, Sir Isaac Newton discovered the color spectrum and explored how each color is defined by a different wavelength of light. In 1704, Newton developed the color wheel. In the early twentieth century, Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung studied the effects of color on the human mind. Jung eventually developed a form of color therapy that allowed his patients to express themselves with colors and images. Today, color psychology is primarily used in marketing and advertising.


Color psychology involves the use of color theory—the practical application of mixing and matching various hues—to explore concepts like color perception and the effect of color combinations
