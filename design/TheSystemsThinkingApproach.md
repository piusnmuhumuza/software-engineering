# The Systems Thinking Approach

## A Three Book review inspired systems thinking approach to understanding Systems.

## Background

We often look too closely at a things, topics, ideas or even people without considering the complexities, relationships, and implications surrounding them. In fact It’s easy to see things when we’re close to them without having to think to deeply about them, but it takes/requires a purposeful effort, a focused mindset, strategic thinking, and perspective on problem-solving to take a step back and look at the bigger picture of things.

To understand Systems Thinking, we need to approach everything with a big-picture thinker, dreamer, or strategist’s mindset due to the curiosity, courage, and the willingness it takes to challenge and question everything and anything. With this mindset, you identify, notice or observe the details of every situation in a large network of complex systems and their larger ecosystems.

## Introduction

Understanding how systems work must begin with a basic idea of what a system is. We often use the word in everyday interactions in phrases like "intelligent systems" "nervous system," "legal system," "school system," "heating system", "Respiratory system" or even "cooling system."
Simply put, a system is a collection of parts that interact with each other to function as a whole. Systems are composed of interrelated parts.

When one of these parts is itself a system (i.e., that part consists of two or more interrelated parts), we call the smaller system a subsystem and the larger system its suprasystem. And that larger system, of course, can be a subsystem of a still larger system.

## What is a System

A system is a set of interacting elements that together make up a whole so that this whole is greater than the sum of the elements. Any system has its own functions, properties, structure, laws of interaction, development, and other parameters. In order for system thinking to help us solve problems and make decisions, we need to learn to see the world as the interaction of systems.
A set of independent things that are interconnected in a way that causes them to produce their own patterns overtime.

The world is a complex system with numerous subsystems and suprasystems. All parts of the system that ensure the required functioning of the system are called subsystems. Everything that is not a subsystem, but interacts with the system, is called a suprasystem. A person, a state, an army, a car, currency, education, social networks, business - all these are systems.

For example, a car is a system. The engine, transmission, wheels, suspension are subsystems, and the driver, road and cargo are suprasystems.

### Introduction to Complex Systems

Complex systems are systems comprised of numerous interconnected components that interact in ways that give rise to new and often unexpected behaviors and are all around us.
In the realm of complex systems, the suprasystem is a crucial concept, representing a level above smaller systems, where interactions between these smaller systems lead to emergent properties and behaviors at a higher, more comprehensive level. Think of it as a system of systems, where the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.
The prefix supra- refers to what is on something else or is superior. A system, meanwhile, is an ordered set of elements that are interrelated.

#### Understanding Suprasystems

A suprasystem, also known as a supersystem, is a system that is made up of other systems; that is, it is a larger system that integrates or contains small systems (known as minor systems or subsystems).
Suprasystems usually have a direct influence on the activities that are executed in the systems they host. 
Suprasystems can be found in various domains, and understanding them is vital to grasping the complexity of our world. In fact, understanding suprasystems can help towards for solving complex global problems like climate change, disease outbreaks, and resource management.

A practical example of a suprasystem is the human body, is made up of the digestive system (which would be a subsystem) and, in turn, the digestive system is made up of the stomach (another subsystem) or the universe, formed by the subsystem of the milky way, and by another subsystem corresponding to the planets.

One of the most complex forms of a system is the social system. Because these systems are composed of individual human beings--who often in turn comprise one or more levels of subsystems--these systems are also among the most unpredictable. This added dimension of unpredictability leads social systems to have unique types of feedback loops.

For example, unlike members or components of nonhuman systems, particular members of a social system may elect to intentionally violate its norms. When this happens, the mechanism that engages to correct this disturbance is a negative feedback loop. This mechanism may simply involve ostracism--or, for more serious offenses, the criminal justice system may become involved.

In either case, negative feedback triggers a reaction that acts to isolate the offender, negating the source of the disturbance. Another example comes from a more specific social system: education. Our public educational systems are ultimately accountable to the political mechanism of the society they serve: in a democracy, this may take the form of public election of a school board. In other forms of government, schools may be subject to a governmental review of their curriculum.

In either case, if the operation of the school drifts outside the bounds of what is acceptable to the community it serves, its control mechanism acts as a negative feedback loop--detecting this divergence and restoring public accountability.

#### Characteristics of a suprasystem

* The suprasystem or supersystem could be understood as the environment or environment for the operation of various systems.
* Suprasystems are divided into complex units that are integrated into it. However, all these units are under his control, as this is the main executor.
* A suprasystem is made up of several systems, while a system can belong to one or more suprasystems.
* Suprasystems are the highest rank in the hierarchy in systems theory. The order from highest to lowest would be suprasystem, system and subsystem.

## The Systems Thinking Approach

The systems thinking approach analyses how the component under study interacts with the other constituents of the system. Systems thinking provides a broad perspective as it works by expanding its view to consider a large number of interactions among structures, patterns, and cycles. Systems thinking provides the means by which interconnections can be recognized as the whole system is viewed which allows for the understanding of how subsystems relate to the entire system.
Along with interconnectedness, systems thinking is also comprised of feedback loops which provide insight into cause-effect relationships between subsystems in the overall system.
This cause-effect relationship is referred to as causality. When mapping out at what causes what to happen in a system, the process of systems mapping is being utilized. The systems map can serve not only as a visual representation of the cause-effect relationship, but also as an analysis of the causality.

### What is Systems Thinking

Systems thinking is a holistic analysis approach that explores how the different parts of a system interrelate while working within and outside the context of other, larger or smaller systems.
It mainly focuses on the way that a how systems work over time, how their constituent parts interrelate and further operate within the context of larger systems which has been used as a way of exploring and developing effective action in complex contexts, enabling systems change.

> Systems thinking originated in 1956 when Professor Jay Forrester founded the Systems Dynamic Group at MIT’s Sloan School of Management.- [A Systems thinking Article by Ben Lutkevich.](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/systems-thinking#:~:text=Systems%20thinking%20originated%20in%201956,MIT's%20Sloan%20School%20of%20Management.)

Systems thinking is used in many areas of research, as it analyses a variety of operational systems, such in domains like medicine, sports, politics, economics, society, culture, religion, technology, management and education to mention but a few.

Systems thinking is about seeing things with an open mind, and recognizing their interconnectedness. More like a way of trying to make sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of systems, subsystems, supra system and their relationships from _large-to-small_ or _small-to-large_ instead of splitting & examining them in parts to helps us be better prepared to solve complex problems.

*Book: The Art Of Thinking In Systems: Improve Your Logic, Think More Critically, And Use Proven Systems To Solve Your Problems - Strategic Planning For Everyday Life by Steven Schuster*

A system is greater than the sum of its constituent components because the relationship between the different components adds value to the system. The definition of systems thinking states that it is a cohesive approach that views all subsystems as parts of an overall system, rather than in isolation or as segments.
The 6 fundamental Concepts of Systems Thinking are  interconnectedness, synthesis, emergence, feedback loops, causality, and systems mapping.

> [Systems theory] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) is the transdisciplinary study of systems. The fundamental concept of systems theory is that the whole system is greater than the totality of its parts.

### Methodologies of systems thinking

Systems thinking uses computer simulation and a variety of diagrams and graphs to model, illustrate, and predict system behaviour. Among the systems thinking tools include the following:
The behaviour over time (BOT) graph, which indicates the actions of one or more variables over a period of time.
The causal loop diagram (CLD), which illustrates the relationships between system elements.
The management flight simulator, which uses an interactive program to simulate the effects of management decisions.
The simulation model, which simulates the interaction of system elements over time.

### Systems Thinking Model

In systems thinking, the analogy of an iceberg is used. The iceberg model is a tool for systems thinking as it depicts what can be seen near the top of the water as observable and what lies far beneath the surface as unobservable. These unobservable elements often cause the observable elements. As pictured below, there is an iceberg. The part of the iceberg under the sea can be divided into four levels: events, patterns, structures, and models. These levels are ordered in such a way that going deeper, or lower, on the iceberg is indicative of a better understanding of the phenomenon or problem at hand.

## Why is Systems Thinking Important

Systems thinking allows system thinkers, recognize parts of a system to the whole system commonly referred to as induction or understand the whole system and, as a result, the parts that make up that system known as deduction as they solve complex problems.

Utilizing an inductive approach or deductive approach will depend on the learning style of the systems thinker as Systems Thinking expand the range of options available for solving a problem by broadening the thinking of systems thinkers thus helping them articulate problems in new and different ways.

This can be very advantageous in that it makes systems thinking very effective when dealing with difficult types of problems that need solutions. Systems thinking is highly beneficial when dealing with complex issues

## THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS(TOC)

[Theory of Constraints (TOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) is a management philosophy developed by Dr. Eli Goldratt (Author), based on the principle that any system, whether it is a business, a manufacturing facility, or any other type of organization, is limited by a small number of constraints, or bottlenecks and, the key to improving the performance of a system is to identify and manage these constraints.

![Theory of Constraints!](https://github.com/piusnmuhumuza/designstudio/blob/main/resources/theoryOfContraints-EliyahuMGoldratt.jpg "Theory of Constraints")*What Is This Thing Called Theory of Constraints*

Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt conceived the [Theory of Constraints (TOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints), and introduced it to a wide audience through his bestselling 1984 novel, “The Goal”. Since then, TOC has continued to evolve and develop, as a significant factor within the world of management best practices.

### WHAT IS THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS?

The [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) is a methodology for identifying the most important limiting factor (i.e., constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal and then systematically improving that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor.

Theory of Constraints builds on the concept that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. In business operations where each process involves a series of steps, the slowest step controls the pace of the whole flow of the process.

Theory of Constraints inherently prioritizes improvement activities and the top priority is always the current constraint.

### The Basics of Theory Of Constraints(TOC)

The core concept of the [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) follows that, every process has a single constraint and the total process throughput can only be improved when the constraint is improved. Therefore, spending time optimizing non-constraints doesn't provide significant benefits thus only improvements to the constraint matter.

TOC seeks to provide precise and sustained focus on improving the current constraint until it no longer limits throughput, at which point the focus moves to the next constraint. The underlying power of TOC flows from its ability to generate a tremendously strong focus towards a single goal (profit) and to removing the principal impediment (the constraint) to achieving more of that goal. In fact, Goldratt considers focus to be the essence of TOC.

### THE NATURE OF CONSTRAINTS | What are Constraints

Every process has a constraint (bottleneck) and focusing improvement efforts on that constraint is the fastest and most effective path to improved profitability.

Constraints are anything that prevents the organization from making progress towards its goal. In manufacturing processes, constraints are often referred to as bottlenecks.

The [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) takes a scientific approach to improvement. It hypothesizes that every complex system, including manufacturing processes, consists of multiple linked activities, one of which acts as a constraint upon the entire system

The ultimate goal of most manufacturing companies is to make a profit – both in the short term and in the long term.

The Theory of Constraints provides a powerful set of tools for helping to achieve that goal, including:

**The Five Focusing Steps:** a methodology for identifying and eliminating constraints
**The Thinking Processes:** tools for analyzing and resolving problems
**Throughput Accounting:** a method for measuring performance and guiding management decisions

#### The Five Focusing Steps**

The Theory of Constraints provides a specific methodology for identifying and eliminating constraints, referred to as The Five Focusing Steps _Process Of On-Going Improvement(POOGI)_

1. **Focusing Step #1:** IDENTIFY the system's constraint.
2. **Focusing Step #2:** EXPLOIT the constraint.
3. **Focusing Step #3:** SUBORDINATE everything else to the constraint.
4. **Focusing Step #4:** ELEVATE the constraint.
5. **Focusing Step #5:** PREVENT INERTIA from becoming the constraint!

#### The Thinking Processes

The Theory of Constraints includes a sophisticated problem solving methodology called the Thinking Processes. The Thinking Processes are optimized for complex systems with many interdependencies (e.g., manufacturing lines). They are designed as scientific “cause and effect” tools, which strive to first identify the root causes of undesirable effects (referred to as UDEs), and then remove the UDEs without creating new ones.

The Thinking Processes are used to answer the following three questions, which are essential to TOC:

What needs to be changed?
What should it be changed to?
What actions will cause the change?

#### Throughput Accounting

Throughput Accounting is an alternative accounting methodology that attempts to eliminate harmful distortions introduced from traditional accounting practices – distortions that promote behaviors contrary to the goal of increasing profit in the long term.

In traditional accounting, inventory is an asset (in theory, it can be converted to cash by selling it). This often drives undesirable behavior at companies – manufacturing items that are not truly needed. Accumulating inventory inflates assets and generates a “paper profit” based on inventory that may or may not ever be sold (e.g., due to obsolescence) and that incurs cost as it sits in storage. The Theory of Constraints, on the other hand, considers inventory to be a liability – inventory ties up cash that could be used more productively elsewhere.

In traditional accounting, there is also a very strong emphasis on cutting expenses. The [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints), on the other hand, considers cutting expenses to be of much less importance than increasing throughput. Cutting expenses is limited by reaching zero expenses, whereas increasing throughput has no such limitations.

These and other conflicts result in the [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) emphasizing Throughput Accounting, which uses as its core measures: Throughput, Investment, and Operating Expense.

### Some of the key concepts in TOC include;-

**The idea of "throughput".**
Defined as the rate at which a system produces money through sales. According to TOC, the goal of a business should be to maximize throughput while minimizing inventory and operational expenses. This is achieved by identifying and managing constraints, and by implementing policies and procedures that focus on increasing throughput.

**the idea of "buffer management".**
The process of managing the resources available to a system in order to ensure that the system can continue to operate effectively, even when faced with unexpected changes or disruptions. By managing buffers, businesses can ensure that they have the resources they need to continue operating, even when faced with unexpected changes or disruptions.

**The importance of "flow" in a system.**
Referring to the smooth flow of materials, information, and resources through a system. By ensuring that materials, information, and resources flow smoothly through a system, businesses can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations.

> “I say an hour lost at a bottleneck is an hour out of the entire system. I say an hour saved > at a non-bottleneck is worthless. Bottlenecks govern both throughput and inventory.” – From The Goal, authored by Eliyahu Goldratt

### About Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt

_[Eliyahu Moshe Goldratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_M._Goldratt) (March 31, 1947 – June 11, 2011) was an Israeli business management guru.He was the originator of the Optimized Production Technique, the [Theory of Constraints (TOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints), [the Thinking Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_processes_(theory_of_constraints)), [Drum-Buffer-Rope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8vi-AlCm6I&ab_channel=EuroLEAN%2B), [Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_chain_project_management) and other TOC derived tools._

[Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_M._Goldratt) was an educator, author, physicist, philosopher and business leader, but first and foremost, he was a thinker who provoked others to think. Often characterized as unconventional, stimulating, and “a slayer of sacred cows,” he urged his audience to examine and reassess their business practices with a fresh, new vision.

Dr. Goldratt was born in Israel on March 31, 1947, into a rabbinic family, the son of Avraham-Yehuda Goldrat. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from Tel Aviv University and a Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy from Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel.

He is the founder of TOC for Education, a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing TOC Thinking and TOC tools to teachers and their students, and Goldratt Consulting. In addition to his pioneering work in business management and education, Dr. Goldratt holds patents in a number of areas ranging from medical devices to drip irrigation to temperature sensors.

Dr. Goldratt is best known as the father of the [Theory of Constraints (TOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints), a process of ongoing improvement that identifies and leverages a system’s constraints in order to achieve the system’s goals. He introduced TOC’s underlying concepts in his business novel, [The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement]((https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal)), which has been recognized as one of the best-selling business books of all time. First published in 1984, [The Goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)) has been updated three times and sold more than 7 million copies worldwide. It has been translated into 35 languages.

Heralded as a “guru to industry” by Fortune magazine and “a genius” by Business Week, Dr. Goldratt continued to advance the TOC body of knowledge throughout his life, building on the Five Focusing Steps (the process of ongoing improvement, known as POOGI) with TOC-derived tools such as [Drum-Buﬀer-Rope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8vi-AlCm6I&ab_channel=EuroLEAN%2B), [Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_chain_project_management)) and the [Thinking Processes]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_processes_(theory_of_constraints))). He authored ten other TOC-related books, including four business novels: It’s Not Luck (the sequel to [The Goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel))), [Critical Chain]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_processes_(theory_of_constraints))), Necessary but Not Sufficient and Isn’t It Obvious? His last book, The Choice, was co-authored by his daughter Efrat Ashlang-Goldratt.

Goldratt died from complications arising from lung cancer on June 11, 2011, at noon, in his home in Israel at the age of 64.

### Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt's Books

## Conclusion

[Systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking) is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts.
Systems thinking can be used in any area of research and has been applied to the study of medical, environmental, political, economic, human resources, and educational systems, among many others.

[Theory of Constraints (TOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) is a management philosophy developed by [Dr. Eli Goldratt (Author)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_M._Goldratt), based on the principle that any system, whether it is a business, a manufacturing facility, or any other type of organization, is limited by a small number of constraints, or bottlenecks and, the key to improving the performance of a system is to identify and manage these constraints.
