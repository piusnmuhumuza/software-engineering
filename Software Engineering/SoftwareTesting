# Software Testing

## Introduction

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a computer program or system functions as intended. 
It involves executing a program or system to identify any errors or gaps between the expected and actual outcomes. 
The goal is to ensure the software meets specified requirements, is free of defects, and works reliably in different scenarios.

## Why is Software Testing Needed?

Software testing plays a crucial role in delivering reliable and high-quality software as well as mitigating risks, enhances user satisfaction, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

It's essential to have robust testing processes to succeed in order to;-

* Identifying Bugs and Defects
* Ensuring Quality
* Meeting Requirements
* Enhancing Reliability
* Preventing Future Issues and many more.

## - Levels of Testing

### Unit Testing:

Testing individual parts or components (units) of a software to ensure they work as intended.
Why? To make sure each piece of the software functions correctly on its own.

### Integration Testing:

Testing how different units or components work together when integrated into a larger system.
Why? To check if the combined units cooperate as expected and don't cause issues when connected.

### System Testing:

Testing the entire system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
Why? To ensure that the complete software system functions correctly and satisfies user needs.

### Acceptance Testing:

Checking if the software meets the requirements and specifications set by the end-users or clients.
Why? To confirm that the software is ready for release and satisfies the user's expectations and needs.
