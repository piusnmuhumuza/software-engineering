## Introduction to Software Project Management

Software project management is the planning, managing and tracking of software development projects. While the deliverable might differ from other projects that produce tangible deliverables, the processes are basically the same as the management of any other type of project.

In Software development projects the software development life cycle (SDLC) process, often overlaps the traditional project management life cycle process and managed together for successful software development.

The Project Management Life Cycle will follow the typical;- _Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring and Control, Closing_ project life cycle phases while The Software Development Life Cycle will typically follow the ;- _Plan, Design, Implement, Test, Deploy, Maintain_ phases.

## Software projects versus other types of project

Many of the techniques of general project management are applicable to software project management, but software projects have certain characteristics that make them different.

The main difference between software and other enterprise projects is that software projects are not physical while others are.

The Characteristics of software projects that make them different from other types of projects include;-

1. Development Process
In software projects, the development process is iterative and involves a lot of testing, debugging, and refinement. On the other hand, other types of projects follow a more linear development process that includes designing, prototyping, testing, and manufacturing.

2. Invisibility
With software, progress is not immediately visible because the work is Logical, but the others structures such as bridges, work progress can be seen immediately. In software development, there is a level of uncertainty.

Detailed software project requirements are not easy to determine precisely before development begins. However, with the introduction of methodologies such as Agile and Scrum, we can overcome this limitation.

3. Complexity
Software projects are more complex than other engineering projects. For example, in a bridge, there is a clear structural relationship between parts, while the relationships between software components are much more complex. We cannot compare the complexity of software until we implement it.

4. Flexibility
A good point of software projects is that they are flexible. The client only wants the final result, so the rest is up to the programmer, who can modify the software at any stage.

While this is not the case with other projects because the client is exposed to everything in progress, he can see what the project manager and the team are working on, so it is not in the hands of the project team.

5. Customization
Software products can be easily customized and updated according to user needs, while other products may require more effort to customize or update.

6. Delivery
Software products can be delivered instantly over the Internet or by other electronic means, while other products require physical delivery, which can take longer.

7. Lifespan
Software products have a shorter lifespan than other products because they are often replaced by newer versions or better alternatives.

8. Cost
Software products are generally cheaper to produce and distribute than other products, which require more resources and materials.

9. Intellectual Property
Software products are more vulnerable to intellectual property theft and infringement because they can be easily copied and distributed, unlike other physically protected products.

10. Conformity
Physical systems are governed by consistent physical law, while Software developers have to conform to the requirements of human clients.
