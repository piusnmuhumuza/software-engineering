# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ECONOMICS | The Economics of Software Engineering

## Introduction

* **Software Engineering** is a technical discipline or approach that applies **computer science** and **engineering** concepts in the design, development, testing and maintenance of quality reliable, usable, and dependable software. Simply put, it's an engineering-based approach to software development.

* **Economics** is the study of how resources (people, time, facilities, money) are used to produce and distribute commodities and how services are provided in society. Economics is classified into microeconomics  and macroeconomics. — Microeconomics is the study of behaviors of individual agents and markets. Macroeconomics is the study of the broad aspects of the economy, for example employment, export, and prices on a national or global scope.


The dictionary defines _"economics"_ as _"a social science concerned chiefly with description and analysis of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services."_

Here is another defInition of economics which I think is more helpful in explaining how economics relates to software engineering.

Economics is the study of how people make decisions in resource-limited situations.
This defInition of economics fIts the major branches of classical economics very well.

Macroeconomics is the study of how people make decisions in resource-limited situations on a national or global scale. It deals with the effects of decisions that national leaders make on such issues "as tax rates, interest rates, foreign and trade policy.


* **[Engineering Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_economics)** is a branch of microeconomics dealing with engineering related economic decisions and the application of economic principles and methods to engineering problems and decisions. It helps in evaluating the costs and benefits of different alternatives, such as projects, products, processes, or policies,in to make the best choice for your team, business or organization.

Engineering economics quantifies the benefits and costs associating with engineering projects to determine if they save enough money to warrant their capital investments.

* **Software economics** deals with the application of economic principles to software development by focusing on the ever challenging issue of valuing software and estimating the costs involved in its production.

* **Software engineering economics** addresses the elements of software project costs estimation and analysis and project benefit-cost ratio analysis. It focuses on the economic analysis techniques and their applicability to software engineering and management.
Software engineering economics addresses the elements of software project costs estimation and analysis.

Software Engineering economics is the application of economic techniques to the evaluation of Software design, development and engineering alternatives. It facilitates assessment of the appropriateness of a given software project, estimating its value, and justifying it from an business & engineering standpoint.

Software Engineering Economics involves formulating, estimating, and evaluating the economic outcomes when alternatives to accomplish a defined software development purpose are available.

Software Engineering Economics are about making decisions related to software engineering in a business context.

## Economic Foundations of Software Engineering

There are fundamental principles and methodologies utilized in engineering economics and their applications in software engineering that form the basis of decision making in the presence of uncertainty. These formal economic models include the cost of production and market models based on fundamental principles of microeconomics. The dynamic values of money and assets, patterns of cash flows, can be modeled in support of management's need to make decisions in the presence the constant uncertainties associated with software development.

Economic analysis methodologies for engineering decisions include project costs, benefit-cost ratio, payback period, and rate of return can be rigorously described. This is the basis of any formal treatment of economic theories and principles. Software engineering economics is based on elements of software costs, software engineering project costs estimation, economic analyses of software engineering projects, and the software maintenance cost model.

## General Economic concepts

* **Demand versus supply.**  Demands and supplies are the fundamental behaviors of dynamic market systems, which form the context of economics.

* **Demand** is the required quantities for a product or service. It is also the demand for labor and materials needed to produce those products and services. Demand is a fundamental driving force of market systems and the predominant reason for most economic phenomena. The market response to a demand is called supply.  

* **Supply** is the required quantities for a product or service that producers are willing and able to sell at a given range of prices. This also extends to the labor and materials needed to produce the product and services to meet the demand.

* **Efficiency:** Efficiency of a system is generally defined as the ratio of its output to input. The efficiency can be classified into technical efficiency and economic efficiency.

* **Technical efficiency:** It is the ratio of the output to input of a physical system. The physical system may be a diesel engine, a machine working in a shop floor, a furnace, etc. (Technical efficiency (%) =  Output/ Input × 100)

* **Economic efficiency:** Economic efficiency is the ratio of output to input of a business system. (Economic efficiency (%) = Output/Input  × 100 = Worth/Cost × 100)

* **Interest:** Money paid for the use of money

* **Investment:** Is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. (Interest = Current Value – Original Amount)

* **Loan:** Is money, property, or other material goods given to another party in exchange for future repayment of the loan value or principal amount, along with interest or finance charges. (Interest = Current Total Owed – Original Amount)

* **Rate of Return (ROR):** Interest accumulated per unit time. (ROR = Interest accumulated per unit time / Original Amount)

* **Time Value of Money (TVM):** Is the money available at the present time is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its potential earning capacity.

* **Present Value (PV):** Is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return.

* **Future Value (FV):** Is the value of a current asset at a future date based on an assumed rate of growth.

* **Cash Flow:** Is the net amount of cash and cash-equivalents being transferred into and out of a business.

* **Interest Rate:** Interest paid per unit time. (Interest Rate = Interest paid per unit time / Original Amount)

* **Money value throughout time:** The time value of money draws from the idea that rational investors prefer to receive money today rather than the same amount of money in the future because of money’s potential to grow in value over a given period of time. For example, money deposited into a savings account earns a certain interest rate and is therefore said to be compounding in value.

* **Simple and compound interest:** Interest is defined as the cost of borrowing money as in the case of interest charged on a loan balance. Interest can be calculated in two ways, simple interest or compound interest.

**Simple interest** is calculated on the principal, or original, amount of a loan. Formula: Simple interest = P x i x n; P = principle, i = interest rate and n = term of the load

**Compound interest** is calculated on the principal amount and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods, and can thus be regarded as “interest on interest.” Formula: Compound interest= [P(1+i)^n]−P & Compound interest = P[(1+i)^n−1]; P = principle, i = interest rate in percentage terms and n = number of compounding periods of year.

* **Nominal and effective interest rate**

Interest rate is one of the most commonly used phrases in fixed-income investment lexicon. The different types of interest rates, including real, nominal, effective and annual, are distinguished by key economic factors, that can help individuals become smarter consumers and shrewder investors.

**Nominal Interest Rate:** Is the stated interest rate of a bond or loan, which signifies the actual monetary price borrowers pay lenders to use their money.

**Effective Interest Rate:** Investors and borrowers should also be aware of the effective interest rate, which takes the concept of compounding into account. «Compounding is the process in which an asset’s earnings.

* **Opportunity Costs** are those cost resulting from the loss of potential gain from the other alternatives then the one alternative chosen by the decision maker. which is where making decisions in the Presence of Uncertainty comes in because making decision is about Opportunity Costs.

Every time we make a decision involving multiple choices we are making an opportunity cost based decisions. Since most of the time, these costs in the future and are uncertainty, we need to estimate those opportunity costs as well as the probability that our choice is the right choice to produce the desired beneficial outcomes.

## Understanding uncertainty in Software Project management

In the presence of uncertainty, making a decision about actions today that impact outcomes in the future require some mechanism for determining those outcomes in the absence of perfect information and this absence of information creates risk.

### These decisions typically have one or more of the following characteristics:

* **The Stakes** — The stakes are involved in the decision, such as costs, schedule, delivered capabilities and those impacts on business success or the meeting the objectives.

* **Complexity** — The ramifications of alternatives are difficult to understand the impact of the decision without detailed analysis.

* **Uncertainty** — Uncertainty in key inputs creates uncertainty in the outcome of the decision alternatives and points to risks that may need to be managed.

* **Multiple Attributes** — Larger numbers of attributes cause a larger need for formal analysis.

* **Diversity of Stakeholders** — Attention is warranted to clarify objectives and formulate performance measures when the set of stakeholders reflects a diversity of values, preferences, and perspectives.

## Reducible and Irreducible Uncertainty

All project work is driven by underlying processes that create a certain probability of uncertainty. There are two types of uncertainty on all projects, called Reducible (Epistemic) and Irreducible (Aleatory) probability.

Aleatory uncertainty arises from the random variability related to natural processes on the project - the statistical processes. Work durations, productivity, variance in quality. Epistemic uncertainty arises from the incomplete or imprecise nature of available information - the probabilistic assessment of when an event may occur.

There is pervasive confusion between these two types of uncertainties when discussing the impacts on these uncertainties on project outcomes, including the estimates of cost, schedule, and technical performance.

## Software Economics In Software Project Management

Success of any software engineering project is partly dependent on effective business management. 

Software Economics in Software Engineering is a research area focusing on the challenges and issues associated with valuing software and determining or estimation costs usually involved in its production(_design, development, Implementation, testing and Maintenance among other things_). 
[Barry Boehm & Kevin J.Sullivan in Software Economics: A Roadmap](https://github.com/piusnmuhumuza/bootcamp/blob/master/Software%20Engineering/resources/softwareEconomics_ARoadMap-Boehm%20and%20Sullivan.pdf) outline these difficulties and challenges and also presented how software economics principles can be applied to improve software design, development, and evolution.

Software economics is basically situated at intersection of information economics and Software Engineering. 

Software engineering economics provides a way to examine the attributes of software and software processes in a systematic way that relates them to economic measures. These can be weighted and analyzed when making decisions within the scope of a software engineering project and its organization. The essence of software engineering economics is aligning software technical decisions with the business goals of the organization.

---key aspects of software engineering economics, including life cycle economics; risk and uncertainty; economic analysis methods and practical considerations, which tie concept and theory to contemporary software economic realities.

Most of software cost models are generally abstracted into function of five basic parameters being;-

* **Size –**
Size is generally measured or qualified in term of number of source instructions or in SLOC (Source line of code) or number of function points required to realize desired capabilities. The size of end product or result is required to develop or create required functionality.

* **Process –**
The process is steps that are used to guide all of activities and produce end products, in particular ability and capability of process to avoid or ignore activities that are not adding any value. It also supports heading towards the target or goal and eliminate activities that are not essential or important.

* **Personnel –**
The capabilities of personnel of software engineering in general, and particularly their experience with issues or problems regarding computer science and issues regarding application domain of project. It emphasizes on team and responsibilities of team.

* **Environment –**
It is simply made of various tools and techniques and automated procedures that are available and used to support software development and effort in an efficient way.

* **Quality –**
The required quality along with its features, performance, reliability, scalability, portability, usability, user interface utility, adaptability, and many more.

Between these parameters, relationship and estimated cost can be written in following way :

```code
Effort = (Personnel) (Environment) (Quality) (Size Process) 
```
