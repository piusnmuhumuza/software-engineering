# Software Economics

Software economics is a mature research area that deals with the ever challenging issue of valuing software and estimating the costs involved in its production.

Software Engineering Economics are about making decisions related to software engineering in a business context.

Success of any software engineering project is partly dependent on effective business management. 

Software engineering economics provides a way to examine the attributes of software and software processes in a systematic way that relates them to economic measures. These can be weighted and analyzed when making decisions within the scope of a software engineering project and its organization. The essence of software engineering economics is aligning software technical decisions with the business goals of the organization.

---key aspects of software engineering economics, including life cycle economics; risk and uncertainty; economic analysis methods and practical considerations, which tie concept and theory to contemporary software economic realities.

## INTRODUCTION

Definitions
The dictionary defines _"economics"_ as _"a social science concerned chiefly with description and analysis of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services."_

Here is another defInition of economics which I think is more helpful in explaining how economics relates to software engineering.

Economics is the study of how people make decisions in resource-limited situations.
This defInition of economics fIts the major branches of classical economics very well.

Macroeconomics is the study of how people make decisions in resource-limited situations on a national or global scale. It deals with the effects of decisions that national leaders make on such issues "as tax rates, interest rates, foreign and trade policy.

## Learning objectives for the Software Engineering Economics.

1. Understand and be able to apply the key software engineering economic fundamentals to real-world software economic issues.
2. Illustrate through example the key software life cycle economics, including product and process life cycles; portfolios; proposals; investment decisions; pricing and costing, and earned value management (EVM).
3. Apply the concepts of risk and uncertainty to realworld software development projects, including goals; estimates; prioritization and decision making.
4. Perform best-practice economic analysis methods.
5. Relate and interpret the “good-enough” principle; friction-free economy; ecosystems and outsourcing
