## Difference between SQL and MySQL

### SQL (Structured Query Language):

- Standardized programming language for managing and manipulating relational databases.
- Not a specific database system but a language used across various relational database management systems (RDBMS).
- Provides commands for tasks like querying data, updating data, inserting data, and deleting data in a relational database.

### MySQL:

- Specific relational database management system (RDBMS).
- Uses SQL as its query language.
- Open-source and widely used for web applications.
Known for performance, reliability, and ease of use.
- Supports a large subset of SQL commands and offers additional features specific to its implementation.

In summary, SQL is a language used for interacting with relational databases, and MySQL is a specific implementation of a relational database management system that uses SQL. MySQL is just one example of an RDBMS that supports SQL.
