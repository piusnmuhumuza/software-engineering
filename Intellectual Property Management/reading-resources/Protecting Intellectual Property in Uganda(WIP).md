# Intellectual Property in Uganda

## Introduction

Even though the Ugandan law protects intellectual property rights, most of the laws aimed at preventing piracy and the distribution of counterfeit goods are yet to be effectively enforced government and while the [URSB]() provides a standardized process for registering each type of intellectual property and allows investors to enforce their rights through the court system, enforcement remains weak.

Uganda signed the [World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO)](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html) Patent Law Treaty in 2000 but has yet to ratify it. 

In August 2021, Uganda did adopt the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO)’s draft protocol on regional voluntary registration of Copyright and Related Rights.  The Protocol was adopted by ARIPO member countries with the aim of ensuring African creators benefit from their creative works.

I have included some interesting reading resources i found while research Intellectual Property management in Uganda.

## Intellectual Property and Developing Countries

As innovativeness, creativity and industrial development trends continue to emerge in developing economies, issues of Intellectual Property over the years have become more notable than before. In fact, every country is obligated to ensure protection of Intellectual Property nationally issued and those regionally and internationally issued.

Analyzing the efficiency of Uganda’s Intellectual Property Rights System (IPRS) in the protection of Intellectual Property rights in light of the national, regional and international developments to  establish whether the IPRS can sufficiently guarantee the enjoyment and protection of Intellectual Property (IP) rights issued under any relevant authority, and in so doing examine whether Uganda’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) protection standards are in conformity with the regional and world intellectual property rights standards.

An Intellectual Property System (IPS) is aimed at giving reasonable statutory grounding to the moral and economic rights of innovators and creators in their creations as well as the accepted rights of the public in accessing those creations.

This protection heavily relies on the effectiveness of the Intellectual Property System and related policies adopted by the country nationally, regionally and internationally.

## Intellectual Property management within Uganda

The protection of Intellectual Property Rights more so patent rights is aimed at contributing to the promotion and development of technological innovation, and the transfer and dissemination of technology in industrial development. For a country that has had laws on intellectual property protection since 1902, there is more left to be desired in respect to enforcement and protection of patents in Uganda. The stimulation of innovation and invention under the Patent System of the country is still very low. The assessment put forward in this research is not limited to the Industrial Property Act of 2014 because Uganda’s Patent System predates the 2014 Act.

As the country aims at industrializing her economy, there is urgent need to address the persistent issues that continually affect the enforcement and protection of patent rights to earn the confidence of potential investors in the different capital ventures or lines of production and industries.

## Intellectual Property Rights in Uganda

Industrial design rights can be relevant to a wide variety of products, ranging from handicrafts such as jewellery to textile (bark cloth) and fabric designs.

Meanwhile, utilisation of local IP rights’ protection will engender the confidence of suppliers of proprietary technologies to avail and exploit their innovations in Uganda. With IP rights secured, suppliers can directly transfer and exploit their innovations through FDI and joint ventures.

They may also exercise the option to grant local users the privileges to exploit their innovations, through licensing agreements, thereby contributing to accelerated industrial and socioeconomic development.

This has been seen through Safeboda, a local Ugandan company, which has been able to secure series A funding in capital raise to the tune of $1.1 million; this would not have been possible if the business owners had not taken deliberate steps to protect their intellectual property interests.

In order for the above to work, Ugandans have to work with enforcement agencies and institutions such as the Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) which has various departments for the purpose of protection of intellectual property rights in Uganda.

## The Protection Intellectual Property in Uganda

Beyond its traditional use, intellectual property is now an asset through which companies can access financing. Uganda recently passed the Security Interest in Moveable Property Act, and the main purpose of this law is to provide for the use of movable property as collateral for credit. Businesses that do not have fixed assets but assets that are created through IP will be used by businesses so as to get loans. IP enhances economic competitiveness because the value of IP is founded in its contribution towards the development and sustainable exploitation of human ingenuity and creativity.

IP significantly contributes to enhancing innovation and creativity by creating streams of revenue through fees collected from purchasing of the invention, licensing and this will lead to new cash streams for Ugandan businesses.

Ugandan businesses should use copyright to protect contemporary traditional cultural expressions of music, paintings and sculptures against any form of unauthorized usage such as reproduction, adaptation, distribution, broadcasting and other forms of communication to the public.

Ugandan businesses should register distinctive indigenous words, names, and symbols such as “Kazire” as trademarks; this combined with an appropriate marketing strategy, can increase consumer recognition of authentic and quality goods which will increase commercial benefits for indigenous enterprises.

Registration of trade secrets will enable businesses to protect secret and commercially valuable information such as traditional manufacturing processes and recipes, preventing that information from being disclosed, acquired, or used by others without consent.

Industrial designs (known as design patents in some jurisdictions) can be used to protect the aesthetic or ornamental aspects of a product rather than its functional aspects; that is, how it looks and feels rather than how it works or what it does.

Prospects for accessing public financing for applied research and development are also strongly tied to end-user utilization of research results, often within time frames that are far too short to facilitate comprehensive protection and commercialization of the associated intellectual property assets that are produced in these processes.

Some higher education and research and development institutions are proactively establishing stronger end-user industry linkages, to facilitate more effective commercialization of their IP assets.

For example, Makerere University has established the Uganda Industrial Research Institute and Makerere University technology business incubators (TBIs) that are fostering commercialization of applied research and development outputs; this has to be deliberately rolled out to other public institutions in the country.

There is also need to create new streams of financing that can support long-term creation of highly-quality products without making succumbing to pressures of short-term loans. Uganda is ready for its indigenous angel investors that shall support businesses in the private sector to carry out research and develop world-class products.

The reality still remains that there must be deliberate attempt by both private and public institutions so as to exploit and utilize this area of the law for the development of businesses.
