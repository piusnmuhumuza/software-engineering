## What is Patenting

## What can be patented?

In order to be patentable, an invention must be novel, it must involve an inventive step, and it must not be prohibited subject matter.11 Each of these requirements will be discussed in more detail further below.

### Novelty

An invention is new if it does not form part of the state of the art before the priority date of the invention.12 The state of the art comprises all matter (whether a product, a process, information about either, or anything else) which has been made available to the public by written or oral description, by use or in any other way. However, disclosure made on a confidential basis does not destroy an inventionâ€™s novelty, but such a disclosure must be done with caution.

### Inventiveness

An invention is deemed to involve an inventive step if it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art to which the invention relates, having regard (with certain exceptions) to any matter, which forms part of the state of the art immediately before the priority date of the invention.

### Prohibited subject matter

The Industrial Properties Act, 2013 provides that the following do not comprise inventions for the purposes of the Act: a discovery; a scientific theory; a mathematical method; a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or any other aesthetic creation; a scheme, rule or method for performing a mental act, playing a game, or doing business; a program for a computer; or the presentation of information. treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or of diagnosis practiced on the human or animal body.

## Patent Law in Uganda

A patent is a is a statutory monopoly granted by the Patent Office on behalf of the state which allows the proprietor of the patent to stop others from exploiting the underlying principle of an invention.7 In particular, a patent comprises a written patent specification document that sets out the scope of protection being claimed by a patentee with respect to an invention.8 In terms of the Industrial Properties Act 2013, a patent may be granted for any new invention that involves an inventive step and that is capable of being used or applied in trade or industry or agriculture.9
An invention on the other hand, may be defined as a new solution to a technical problem.10 The aim of a patent system is to encourage economic and technological development by rewarding intellectual creativity. Example of inventions: electric iron, safety pin, ball point pen, telephone, etc

## Challenges to protection of patents in Uganda.

Uganda like many countries in Africa, protection of Intellectual Property(IP) is still patchy or undeveloped, and many innovators are put off by the onerous and expensive affair of registering their products due to a number of reasons. That explained alongside Political instability, Poor leadership, Lack of advanced technology, Low level of education and infrastructure hinder patent development in Uganda and Africa in general and are explained in detail below.

### Absence of strong Intellectual Property Laws

At the moment, there is no specific/concrete national policy on intellectual property rights in Uganda.14 What could be referred to as the national policy may only be construed from the various pieces of legislation (both substantive and subsidiary legislation) that are currently in the statute books as well as from the various policy statements that have been uttered by various government officials in this regard.15 In addition, part of the policy pertaining to IP rights may be, by implication, read in international conventions and treaties to which Uganda is a signatory, like the TRIPS agreement.

### Lack of awareness of the existing law

One problem facing Africa's 54 countries (or more, depending on how you count countries and which ones you recognize) is that it is difficult to obtain information as to what the law is and how it works.16 Most African countries have very small IP professions, which means that there is little or no economic incentive for any publisher to assume the financial burden of launching and selling specialist law journals, law reports, and practitioners' reference works.17 For the insider, this means an increased degree of reliance on one's own personal knowledge and experience, and of reliance on the assistance of one's closest colleagues; for the outsider it means that advice relating to the filing of a patent, cannot be found without making personal contact with an expert in the country or countries concerned. It also means that, where the same question is asked of several practitioners in the same jurisdiction, their answers are different not because they each analyse the application of the law to a set of facts in a different way but because they often seem to hold different pieces of their country's legal jigsaw in their hands.

### Low interest in Intellectual Property

A further problem is that the general level of interest and excitement regarding IP rights which is found in Uganda is low. In many countries where IP is seen as an imported commodity that must be paid for, with consequences for their balance of payments, and where local need (in the case of patented health care products) or demand (in the case of branded fashion items and consumer goods) runs higher than the ability to pay for it, it is easy to see why local resentment of foreign IP runs high as well.18 Hence in a country where problems of internal security, external threats, environmental disaster, and demographic instability are so great that IP is viewed as a distraction from the immediate concern for survival.
