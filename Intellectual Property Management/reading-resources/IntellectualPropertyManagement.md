## Acknowledge

When i initially started reading and researching about Intellectual Property, there was not alot of information to go about on especially specific to Uganda.
I relied on Books by writers, publications by law companies in Uganda as well as Articles from Legal Practitioners of IP in Uganda.

## Disclaimer

This content is sourced and curated for learning purposed. I personally struggled to find relevant sources to read from when educating myself about intellectual property and for that reason, I decided to write a few articles on the information I had collected from various sources while reading and learning about intellectual property.

*Feel free to leave a comment as your insights can be a source of new information for me or another reader of this article.*

## Resource Structure Information

### The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is the global forum for intellectual property poi,icy, services, information and cooperation. WIPO is a self-funding agency of the United Nations, with 193 Member States. Its mission is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international intellec­tual property system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all. WIPO's mandate, gover­ning bodies and procedures are set out in the WIPO Convention, which established WIPO in 1967.

### The WIPO Academy

 It is a division of WIPO established in 1998. The WIPO Academy is the center of exce­llence for intellectual property (IP) education and training for WIPO Member States, in particular develo­ping countries, least developed countries (LDCs) and countries in transition. 

The Academy works to help build human capacity in IP, which is essential for innovation. Its four programs cover a rich portfolio of both general and specialized courses on IP, and cater to different target audiences. Courses combine fa­ ce-to-face and distance learning methodologies, and are taught by IP experts. 
 
 The aim of the Academic Institutions program is to support access to IP higher education, especially to participants from develo­ping countries, LDCs and countries in transition. One of the main means of achieving this aim is through the Joint Master's Programs on IP, offered in cooperation with selected academic institutions.

### The African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARll?O)

The African Regional Intellectual Property Organization ARIPO) is a intergovernmental organization es­tablished by the Lusaka Agreement in 1976. The main objective for establishing ARIPO is to pool resour­ces of the member states together, for the promotion, development, and use of intellectual property (IP) for economic development. Currently, ARIPO has 22 member states with·t headquarters in Harare, Zim­babwe.

Article Ill of the Lusaka Agreement mandates ARIPO to establish schemes for the training of staff in the administration of Intellectual Property laws, org,anize training seminars and other meetings on Intellectual Property matters and promote the exchange of ideas and experience as well as conduct research studies in the field of IP. Through the ARIPO Academy, the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization provides capacity-building activities for the development of Africa as a whole.

### WIPO & ARIPO

ln July 2006, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) held a Colloquium at the ARIPO Headquarters on
Intellectual Property (IP) education, training and research. During the Colloquium, the participants called for an emergency action plan to address the critical shortage of intellectual property professionals and ex­perts in Africa. They requested the WIPO Academy and ARIPO in cooperation with Universities in Africa to establish an academic programme at the level of a Master in Intellectual Property (MIP) Degree, in one of the Universities in the member states of ARIPO. It was felt that this approach would provide a pragma­ tic response to the need for enhancement of the human resources development in IP in Africa.

## Introduction to Intellectual Property

Intellectual Property Management now plays a vital role in economic growth, fostering innovation, artistic creations, and business legal proceedings. Ownership rights in copyrights, trademarks, and patents among other Intellectual Property has evolved over the years.

The earliest mentions of Intellectual Property (IP) began as early as 500 BCE in Sybaris, a Greek state where citizens could obtain and be granted a one-year patent for “any new refinement in luxury.”

Throughout centuries of development and innovation, Intellectual Property as we know it today has undergone a lot of adjustments thus providing inventors, innovators, and creators with multiple options to protect it.

In the ensuing centuries, Patent, trademark, and copyright laws among other intellectual Property have since become more complex but the intent remains the same. Countries establish intellectual property laws to foster creativity and to make it possible for the inventor to reap the benefits of their ingenuity.

### What is Intellectual Property?

Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creative works or intangible creations of the human intellect like;- literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names and images used in business that are a result of an individual’s original creativity (the creations of one’s creative mind) for which legal rights arise or are granted. An idea in someone’s mind is not intellectual property.

An idea in someone’s mind is not Intellectual Property.

Identifying Intellectual Property & protecting it begins with an individual or entity considered the creator of creative works gaining rights over their creative works which is called Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).

### History of Intellectual Property

The complex and fascinating history of **Intellectual property** (IP) arguably began way back in the 6th Century BC, at the time when it became possible for citizens to obtain a one-year patent for “any new refinement in luxury” a period within which the profits arising were secured to the inventor of the patent.

Various writings indicate that, in an ancient Greek state called Sybaris, located in what is now southern Italy (***situated on the Gulf of Tarentum, near present Corigliano, Italy***), bakers were granted a year-long monopoly on the production of a particular type of bread while authors in the roman empire, were granted the exclusive right to publish their works for a period of 50 years.

There are conflicting stories about the 1st ever granted patents but records show, “***the first known patent***” was granted in 1421 to an Italian inventor named [Giovanni de’ Dondi](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/dondi-giovanni) but also “***the first recorded patent for an industrial invention***” was granted to the architect and engineer [Filippo Brunelleschi](https://www.biography.com/artists/filippo-brunelleschi) in Florence, also in1421(*The patent gave him a three-year monopoly on the manufacture of a barge with hoisting gear used to transport marble.)*

Patent, trademark, and copyright laws have become more complicated in the ensuing centuries given their broad coverage now but the intent has almost remained the same.

#### The begins

The first formal patent legal institutions were developed in the Republic of Venice in the mid-1400s. In fact, the [history of patents and patent law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_patent_law) is generally considered to have started with the Venetian Statute of 1474.

The [Venetian Statute of 1474](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Patent_Statute) decreed that the inventors of new and useful devices would be protected from infringers and copiers for ten years so long as they disclosed the details of their inventions.

Most Venetian patents were granted in the field of glass making, and when these glass makers emigrated to other countries in Europe, they sought similar protections from the local authorities. This is how the notion of patent rights, and their expression in patent legal systems, began to spread and gain acceptance throughout Europe.

#### The 16th Century

European countries made several other important innovations in their early patent systems. In the mid-1500s, France became the first to publish patent descriptions from inventors who chose to submit them.

English and French monarchs also used patents to stimulate invention and grant exclusive trade monopolies to those favoured by the court.

In the reign of Elizabeth I in the late1500s, patent monopolies were granted for trading in staples such as salt, soap, starch, iron, and paper which to favoured monopolists, enriching them while robbing the community which neither stimulated industrial growth nor facilitating new technological developments.

#### The 17th Century

The modern concept of Intellectual Property (IP) did not emerge until the 17th century, due to public outcry, when Elizabeth’s successor James I was forced to revoke these grants of trade monopolies in 1610.

And in 1624, the English Parliament passed the [Statute of Monopolies](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Statute-of-Monopolies), limiting the ability of the monarch to grant monopolies to select/favoured individuals or companies. The Statute formally repealed the practice and henceforth restricted patent rights solely to new inventions which allowed inventors to freely market their inventions without fear of government interference.

This was the first step towards the development of modern Intellectual Property law as it recognized that ideas and inventions could be owned by individuals. Henceforth, countries began establishing intellectual property laws to foster creativity and to make it possible for the inventor to reap the benefits of their ingenuity.

#### The 18th Century

During this period, the United States and France adopted patent and copyright laws. These laws were designed to encourage creativity and innovation by giving creators the exclusive right to use their inventions and work for a certain period of time.

England under the reign of Queen Anne (1702–1714) was the first to require inventors to submit a written description of their patent to “*describe and ascertain the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.*”

In 1710, the British Parliament passed the [Statute of Anne](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3389#:~:text=It%20was%20enacted%20in%20the,any%20book%20already%20in%20print.), which established the first copyright law in the world. [The Statute of Anne](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3389#:~:text=It%20was%20enacted%20in%20the,any%20book%20already%20in%20print.) granted authors the exclusive right to print and publish their works for a period of 14 years. This law was later adopted by other countries and is considered to be the foundation of modern copyright law.

In 1729, France began to publish abbreviated digests of patent descriptions, but these were intermittent and subject to delays of up to 60 years after the patents were originally granted. As might be expected, this lack of regularity limited the technological knowledge sharing which is one of the great benefits of a patent system.

In 1790, the United States enacted the first federal copyright law. Modelled off Britain’s [The Statute of Anne](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3389#:~:text=It%20was%20enacted%20in%20the,any%20book%20already%20in%20print.), this new law was relatively limited in scope, protecting books, maps, and charts and granted authors the exclusive right to publish their works for a period of fourteen(14) years with a renewal period of another 14 years. The law was later extended to include other forms of creative expression, such as music and art.

#### The 19th Century

There was a growing recognition of the importance of protecting Intellectual Property (IP) which led to the development of new forms of IP, such as patents and trademarks. Thus, the world’s two main IP treaties were adopted: the Paris Convention (1883) for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Berne Convention (1886) for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.

These treaties have been ratified by over 180 countries and form the basis of modern IP law.

* In 1883, the world’s first international IP convention was held in Paris and the [Paris Convention](https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/history.html#:~:text=1883%20%E2%80%93%20Paris%20Convention,are%20protected%20in%20other%20countries.) was adopted, to facilitate the protection of Industrial Property.
* In 1886, [The Berne Convention](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/) was adopted, at an international assembly held in the Swiss city of Bern by ten European countries with the goal to agree on a set of legal principles for the protection of original work.

#### The 20th Century, To date

In the 20th century, IP law continued to develop and in 1967, the [World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) was established](https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/history.html), an international organization that promotes the protection of IP around the world.

And in 1994, the Agreement on [Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm) (TRIPS) was adopted. It is a multilateral agreement that sets minimum standards for IP protection in all member countries, administered by the [World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/index.htm) (WTO). [TRIPS](https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text/305907) has been credited with helping to boost economic growth and innovation in developing countries.

Today, Intellectual Property Management, a complex and ever-evolving field is an important part of the global economy because IP-protected products and services account for a significant share of global trade.

There are several different types of intellectual Property (IP), including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and therefore, IP protection is seen as a key driver of economic growth and innovation.

As a result, IP law is constantly being updated to reflect the changing needs of society.

### Patents & Utility Models

A patent is a legal document that gives an inventor the exclusive right to make, use, sell, and offer to sell the invention for a period of 20 years. This incentivizes inventors to invest the time and money necessary to develop new products and services.

Patents are granted for inventions that are new, useful, and non-obvious, therefore it’s important to consult with experienced patent legal personnel when considering filing for a patent.

Without patents, inventors would risk having their inventions copied unlawfully making it difficult to recoup their investment in time, research and development.

### Copyrights

A copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to copy, distribute, adapt, display, perform creative work, and create derivative works of the copyrighted work usually for a limited time, — a period of the author’s life plus 70 years, after which it goes to the public domain. The duration of copyright protection varies from country to country.

Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. Original works of authorship can be books, music, movies, and software among other things.

### Trademarks

Trademarks are granted for words, phrases, symbols, or designs that are used to identify and distinguish the goods or services of one party from the goods or services of others. Trademarks can be registered for a period of 10 years, and they can be renewed indefinitely.

Trademarked words, names, and symbols are valuable business assets which can help businesses build strong brand recognition distinguishing their products or services from those of their competitors. This can help attract customers commanding a huge market share for products or services on the market.

### Trade Secrets

Trade Secrets are any confidential information that gives a business an advantage over its competitors. Trade secrets can include formulas, recipes, customer lists, and business plans.

Unlike, IPs, such as Patents and Copyrights which require disclosure in order to be granted protection for a period of time against competitors, Trade Secrets can be protected without public disclosure, infact they can only be protected by law if they are kept confidential.

## What is Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)?

Intellectual property rights (IPRs) are the rights given to creators of intellectual property. These rights can be used to prevent others from using or copying the creator’s work without permission.

IPRs can be registered with a government agency, in a given country (here in Uganda; — [URSB](https://ursb.go.ug/intellectual-property)), state or even internationally([WIPO](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html)).

Intellectual Property Rights are protected through Intellectual Property Law with the help of components like; — patents, copyright, trademarks and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they have created for a certain period of time.

## What is Intellectual Property Law (IPL)?

Intellectual property law is a body of law that protects the rights of creators of intellectual property. It includes laws on patents, copyright, trademarks, and other forms of intellectual property.

## The basics of intellectual property policies

Intellectual property (IP) policies are a set of rules and regulations that govern the creation, use, and protection of IP. They are designed to encourage creativity and innovation and to ensure that IP is used fairly and ethically.

IP policies are a complex and ever-changing area of law. If you are involved in business or creativity, it is important to understand the basics of IP policies and to take steps to protect your IP.

## Intellectual Property Violation/ Infringements

Intellectual property (IP) violation or infringement is the use of another person’s IP without their permission. IP violation can have serious consequences, including financial losses, legal penalties, and damage to reputation.

### There are many ways to violate IP which are;-

* Patent infringement is when someone makes, uses, or sells a patented invention without permission.
* Copyright infringement is where someone copies, distributes or performs copyrighted material without permission.
* Trademark infringement is when someone uses a trademark that is identical or confusingly similar to another trademark without permission.
* Trade secret infringement is when someone steals or misappropriates trade secrets, such as confidential business information.

And by knowing these violations, you can avoid IP violations while protecting your own IP rights.

If you believe that your IP has been violated, you should take steps to protect your rights by filing a lawsuit against the infringer or take other steps, such as sending a cease-and-desist letter.

It is important to note that IP violation is a complex issue. If you believe that your IP has been violated, you should consult with an attorney to discuss your options.

You can avoid IP violation through awareness of IP rights, Getting permission, and also apply proper attribution when using someone else’s Intellectual Property.

## The benefits of Intellectual Property protection

Intellectual property (IP) protection is the legal framework that protects the rights of creators of Intellectual Property. IP protection is important for economic growth and we need to support it in order to encourage creativity and innovation.

* IP protection is important for economic growth because it encourages creativity and innovation. By giving creators the exclusive right to use their creations, IP protection allows creators to earn a return on their investment and recoup the costs of developing their creations. This, in turn, encourages more people to create new and innovative works.
* IP protection encourages creativity and innovation. When creators know that their work will be protected, they are more likely to invest time and resources into developing new ideas. This can lead to new products and services that can benefit society as a whole.
* IP protection is positively correlated with economic growth as countries with strong IP protection tend to have higher rates of economic growth and IP protection is a key factor in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) which is a key source of capital for developing countries leading to job creation and economic growth. When foreign investors know that their IP will be protected in a country, they are more likely to invest in that country.
* IP protection can help to improve the efficiency of markets. When IP is not protected, it can lead to market failures. For example, if a company invests in developing a new product, but its competitors can copy the product without permission, the company may not be able to recoup its investment. This can lead to less innovation and less economic growth.

## Who can benefit from Intellectual Property knowledge; —

* Various Individuals in the innovation ecosystem like Innovators, Inventors, artists, business technologists, software developers/engineers, startup founders, investors, and researchers who, with key Intellectual Property knowledge like how and why you should, protect your creations can command a good market share of the economy in their respective geographical locations and industries.
* Policymakers, legal professionals, and licensing and technology transfer professionals with good knowledge of the intellectual property system (Rights & Laws) can use the available resources to help their clients, their organizations, or overall brands gain a competitive edge in the marketplace or economy.
* Academicians, scholars, and even educators who through research or preparing relevant learning material can help students understand the role intellectual property plays in their future careers as they get ready to join the global economy or set scholarly academic roadmaps.

## The Philosophy of Intellectual Property**

The philosophy of intellectual property (IP) is a complex, ever-evolving field and a controversial issue. There are a number of different arguments for and against IP protection, and the debate on the philosophy of IP is likely to continue for many years to come.

## Common arguments in favour of IP protection include; —

* **Incentives for creativity and innovation:** IP protection is often seen as a way to incentivize creativity and innovation. By giving creators the exclusive right to use their creations, IP protection allows them to earn a return on their investment and recoup the costs of developing their creations. This, in turn, encourages more people to create new and innovative works.

* **The reward for labour:** IP protection is also seen as a way to reward creators for their labour. When creators spend time and effort developing new ideas, they should be able to benefit from their work. IP protection helps to ensure that creators are rewarded for their labour.

* **Public good:** IP protection can also be seen as a way to promote the public good. By encouraging creativity and innovation, IP protection can lead to new products and services that benefit society as a whole. For example, IP protection for pharmaceutical companies has led to the development of new drugs that have saved millions of lives.

## Common arguments against IP protection include; —

* **Exclusivity:** IP protection can lead to exclusivity, which can stifle competition and innovation. For example, when a company has a patent on a new drug, it may be the only company that can produce and sell that drug. This can lead to higher prices for consumers and less competition.

* **Misuse:** IP protection can also be misused. For example, companies may use IP protection to stifle competition or to prevent others from using their ideas. This can harm consumers and stifle innovation.

* **Public domain:** Some people argue that IP should be in the public domain, meaning that it should be freely available for everyone to use. This would allow everyone to benefit from new ideas and inventions, regardless of who created them.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to support IP protection is a complex one. There are a number of factors to consider, including the potential benefits and drawbacks of IP protection, as well as the specific circumstances of each case.

## CONCLUSION

This Intellectual Property Management Resource is prepared for and mean't to benefit professionals from diverse backgrounds like Licensing Managers, Lawyers, Creatives, Intellectual Property Managers, R&D Managers and Scientists, Innovators and Inventors, Academics, Project managers, Product Managers and Designers, Marketing and Branding Specialists among others who want to gain a comprehensive understanding of Intellectual Property laws, rights, and strategies.

Intellectual property (IP) protection is the legal framework that protects the rights of creators of IP, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names and images used in business.

By giving creators the exclusive right to use their creations, IP protection allows creators to earn a return on their investment and recoup the costs of developing their creations. This, in turn, encourages more people to create new and innovative works.

As an innovator, entrepreneur, business actor, policy maker, or creator of any kind to mention but a few, equipping yourself with the necessary knowledge to protect and capitalize on your Intellectual Property (IP) is no longer an option.

The history of Intellectual property (IP) is long and complex, however, it is clear that IP rights play an important role in encouraging creativity and innovation which is important for economic growth.

As new technologies are constantly being developed, and new challenges to IP rights are emerging. IP law is becoming very important in intellectual Property management and by protecting the rights of creators, IP law helps to ensure that the benefits of new ideas and inventions are shared with society as a whole in the long run while also rewarding the creators/owners.
