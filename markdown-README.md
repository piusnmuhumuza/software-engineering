# README 101

This is my first attempt at writing a markdown document to be pushed to github. I made use of Video tutorials; [Markdown Crash course by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo&ab_channel=TraversyMedia), [Mastering Markdown - Detailed Crash Course by Oston Code Cypher ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqUJ7nLSLzs&ab_channel=OstonCodeCypher) & [Academic Writing in Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAJMSS8pvs&ab_channel=NicholasCifuentes-Goodbody).

I intend to master Markdown and use it for software Documentation, Academic writing as well as other Technical writng endeavour. 
This file explains what a readme file is, so dig in.

## So What is it?
A [README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README "A README wiki description") is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.

## Why should I make it?
It's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will likely have regarding how to install and use your project and also how to collaborate with you.

## Who should make it?
Anyone who is working on a programming project, especially if you want others to use it or contribute.

## When should I make it?
Definitely before you show a project to other people or make it public. You might want to get into the habit of making it the first file you create in a new project.

## Where should I put it?
In the top level directory of the project. This is where someone who is new to your project will start out. Code hosting services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/piusmnwilson "My Github Profile"), will also look for your **README** and display it along with the list of files and directories in your project.

## How should I make it?
While READMEs can be written in any text file format, the most common one that is used nowadays is [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Wiki Discription"). It allows you to add some lightweight formatting. You can learn more about it at the [CommonMark website](https://commonmark.org/), which also has a helpful [reference guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) and an [interactive tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

You can use any text editor. There are plugins for many editors (e.g. [Atom](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview), [Emacs](https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode), [Vim](https://github.com/instant-markdown/vim-instant-markdown), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview)) that allow you to preview Markdown while you are editing it.

You can also use a dedicated freeware Markdown editor like [Typora](https://typora.io/) and MIT Licensed [Atom](https://atom.io/) or an online one like [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/).
