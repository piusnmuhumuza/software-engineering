# Enterprise Architecture

Enterprise Architecture(EA) is an important discipline, as organizations need to understand the fundamental aspects of their business in order to keep pace with the global market and technology changes in a continually evolving world. 

With Enterprise Architecture(EA) you learn how to model an Enterprise using TOGAF, including working with the Architecture Development Method (ADM) and metamodel attributes.

## The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)

[The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework) is a framework in enterprise architecture that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise information technology architecture.

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is one of the most widely accepted methods for developing enterprise architecture. It's a high-level approach to design typically modeled at four levels: _Business, Application, Data, and Technology_. and relies heavily on modularization, standardization, and already existing, proven technologies and products.
