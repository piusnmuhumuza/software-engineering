# Software Project Management


### Key Activities in Software Engineering when managing Software Projects

Good software is characterized by functional and non-functional requirements among other client needs often specified from which an analysis/planning is made to ascertain a scope. It will also undergo a life-cycle(software process), that involves engineering phases, consisting of concept creation, requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, testing, and deployment.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the process for planning, creating, testing, deploying and post improvement (where required) of a software product. â€” It consists of stages (Analysis/ Planning, Design, Development/Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and then maintenance.) which are sometimes unchangeable at certain levels depending on the industry, client requirements and team. 

As software evolves, it will undergo monitoring, maintenance and continuous improvement cycles and each software development lifecycle model provides specific guidance to the sequencing and repetition of life cycle activities to deliver high-quality software systems.

Project management in a software engineering environment is unique because of the technical aspects of a software project. While software engineers are generally accountable for the technical aspects of a project, the project manager is accountable for organizational aspects. Sometimes a project manager can be the Software Developer on a project.

The success of an SDLC depends on the people, process, and product and software project management is the glue that holds these aspects together.

#### Software Requirements Gathering and Analysis

During requirements gathering/elicitation, Software Engineer/Developer or Business Analysts interact and collaborate with the various stakeholders, including customers and users, to gather information, assemble the insight, identify, translate, analyze and validate the project's needs about the current state of a software system and desired future state of the software system to be developed. 
Getting familiar with the data, information types, requirements collection techniques, application types, client engineering techniques can go a long way to help your business case. 

### Software Design and Modelling

After requirements and analysis, a Software Engineer/Developer must transform the analysis model into a design model that can be implemented in a specific hardware and software environment.

Good Software design is fundamental to creating successful software which starts with gathering requirements followed by precisely articulating complex ideas using industry-standard design visual language tools such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) which enables you specify, construct, and document the artifacts of the software systems among other activities.

### Software Implementation

Implementation, is the process of converting the specified requirements into an actual software product. This can be programming, coding source code and execution. Software implementation also involves customer engineering to ensure software is working as expected of the client/end user during implementation and deployment.

In most business settings, steps like implementing, testing (User acceptance testing) and deployment can happen concurrently or inter-changeably depending on client requirements or team.

## Software Testing

In the software business, a software product is tested thoroughly like before being shipped to the client. During Software Testing, you validate if the finished product meets set software, requirements, industry standards and passes user acceptance to make sure everything comes together correctly to deliver a software system that performs as expected, functionally and non-functionally.
At a granular level, the purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements and check whether the said software product is defect-free and matches the expected client requirements.

### Who does software testing?

* Software Tester
* Software Developer/Engineer.
* Software Quality Assurance Engineers can also test.
* Project Lead/Manager
* End User/Client.

### Why is Software Testing Needed?

Software testing plays a crucial role in delivering reliable and high-quality software as well as mitigating risks, enhances user satisfaction, and ensuring a smooth user experience. It's essential to have robust testing processes to succeed in order to;-

* Identifying Bugs and Defects
* Ensuring Quality
* Meeting Requirements
* Enhancing Reliability
* Preventing Future Issues and many more.


### Software Project Handover

Software Project handover is the transfer of roles and responsibilities for a software project from one company, team, or person to another.

It is a complex process that includes user acceptance testing, deployment, acceptance criteria, post hand-over maintenance, project to mention but a few depending on the client or the team handling the software project.

Even though project handover is an important part of the software product lifecycle, it can be costly or take unpredictable turns unless appropriate precautionary steps are taken.

Typically, all stakeholders of the software project are present if possible for the hand over where final sign off take place and the Software product is handed of signaling the end of the project and making way for any post-project activities like support, maintenance and continuous improvement
